There are 85 high quality building units that meet the standards of industrial manufacturing needs at Tunas 1 Industrial. Dozens of tenants from various national and multi-national companies chose Tunas 1 Industrial as the best place for their business operations and development.\nAs Batam's economy has grown very rapidly in recent years, this has led to an increase in demand for new industrial land in Batam. Therefore, in March 2012 PT Tritunas Bangun Perkasa continued the construction of the Tunas Batam Center Industrial Estate to the second phase of the project, namely Tunas 2 Industrial.\nAlso followed in May 2012, we built Tunas Bizpark as a business area connected to Tunas 1 and Tunas 2 Industrial. Now, Tunas Batam Center Industrial Estate has become a complete integrated commercial and industrial area with a total land area of ​​64 hectares.\"", "Status (Operational, Operational with Continued Construction, Under Construction, Before Construction, Unclear, Stalled)": "Operational", "Year Operations Began": 2000.0, "Year Construction Began": null, "Year Founded": null, "Age": 23.0, "Dispute": null, "Dispute Explanation": null, "Legal dispute with Indonesian government": null, "Legal dispute with a company": null, "Dispute with local residents": null, "Worker's rights dispute": null, "Environmental Concerns": null, "Environmental Concerns Explanation": null, "Land Acquistion Issues": null, "Specific mention of renewable energy": null, "Mention of environmentally friendly practices": null, "Electric Vehicle (Production Mentioned)": null, "Nickel": null, "Main Industry": "Mixed/General", "Main Industry Notes": "Mix - Electronics, Metal Stamping, Glass, Aluminum, Packaging, Consumer Goods, Plastic Moulding, Garment, Cigarettes, Marine Repair, Warehouse, Printing, Rubber, Manufacturing, Agriculture, Leather Seats, Cocoa, Calbe, Stainless Steel Wire ", "August 2023 Sentinel Check": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 104.0748073, 1.108679961 ] } },

The disposal of factory liquid waste at Hyundai is not in accordance with regulations.\n\"Hyundai admits its guilt,\" said Head of the Civil and Administrative Section of the Cikarang District Attorney Rolando Ritonga recently.\nRolando said, Hyundai did not extend the liquid waste disposal permit (IPL C). Hyundai's industrial waste has also exceeded the quality standard threshold.\n\"Results of a study by the Ministry of Environment, the Cikadu river, which flows into the CBL river to the sea, is experiencing extraordinary pollution due to Hyundai's waste disposal,\" said Rolando.\nThe lawsuit was then settled for Rp. 2 billion\nOn June 6, 2014, the Bekasi Regency Government sued PT Hyundai Inti Development in a civil lawsuit with a compensation value of IDR 16 billion.\nPT Hyundai Inti Development is the manager of the Hyundai industrial area and is responsible for permitting the disposal of liquid waste from local factories.\nThe value of IDR 16 billion is determined based on calculations from the Ministry of Environment experts. \"Compensation is calculated from 2010 to February 2014,\" said Rolando.\nInitially, the government and Hyundai negotiated out of court. Hyundai stated that it was only able to pay compensation of 147 million. The government refused.\nHyundai then increased its offer to Rp 200 million, but the government still refused. Finally, Hyundai agreed to Rp 400 million. The government still refuses.\n“Finally brought to court. The government and Hyundai agreed on a figure of Rp 2 billion. It must be paid no later than November 2015. The money goes to the regional administration,\" said Rolando.\nIn addition to paying Rp 2 billion, Hyundai is required to repair the sewage system so there will be no more pollution. Within 8 months, the canal repair should be completed.\n\"If it doesn't complete the repairs within the allotted time, Hyundai will have to pay Rp 5 billion. That's the deal,\" he said.\nPT Hyundai Inti Development's lawyer, Army Mulyanto, explained that his client had paid Rp. 1 billion to the West Java Bank (BJB) account belonging to the Bekasi Regency Government.\n\"Hyundai has paid Rp. 1 billion in early October. The drawback, another Rp. 1 billion, is paid no later than 30 days after the first payment,\" said Army.\nAccording to the Army, Hyundai is also working on repairing the sewage channel that will flow into the Cikadu River as agreed with the government.\n“Hyundai will fulfill all the agreements. As for channel repairs, Hyundai is currently repairing them,\" said Army.\nJust to note, the Hyundai Bekasi industrial area was built by PT Hyundai Inti Development on an area of ​​200 hectares in Bekasi Regency and was operational in 1991.\nPT Hyundai Inti Development is a joint venture between Hyundai Corporation (South Korea) and PT.

Rita Susilawati, Head of the Center for Groundwater and Environmental Geology (PATGTL) at the Geological Agency, said that the lowering of the groundwater level, which is in a delicate condition, is due to excessive water withdrawal.  Rita revealed, based on the Groundwater Conservation Map of the Bandung–Soreang Groundwater Basin (CAT) compiled by the Geological Agency in 2010, in the Cileunyi area and its surroundings there has been a decrease in the pressured groundwater level (deep groundwater or artesian) to around 60 meters below the ground surface. local.\nSo that the area, he continued, is a vulnerable area with a reduction rate of 40 percent to 60 percent from the initial condition. \"This phenomenon was seen in several places, including around the Cileunyi area to the Rancaekek area and its surroundings,\" he said via text message, Monday (6/2/2023). According to him, the Rancaekek area and its surroundings have a confined aquifer system (deep aquifer or artesian) at a depth of around 50 to 150 meters.\nThis area is hydrogeologically an area of ​​groundwater discharge from the Bandung–Soreang CAT. \"The pattern of depressed groundwater flow (deep groundwater) in the plains of Rancaekek and its surroundings indicates a conical phenomenon of lowering the groundwater level which indicates very intensive groundwater extraction,\" he said. In fact, he continued, the Rancaekek area has experienced a decrease in the depressed groundwater level (deep/artesian groundwater) to more than 70 meters below the local ground level. This causes the area to be an area prone to damage with a reduction rate of 40 percent to more than 80 percent from the initial condition. His party said that after 2010, the Geology Agency did not carry out monitoring of groundwater conditions in the Cileunyi and Rancaekek areas which were included in the Bandung-Soreang CAT. That authority, continued Rita, belongs to the government of West Java Province. \"Currently the authority to manage groundwater has changed to being based on river areas, and the Bandung area, which is included in the Citarum River area, becomes central authority, so that in 2023 the Geological Agency will again carry out groundwater monitoring activities in Bandung and its surroundings,\" he added. Water Conditions Rita added, the cause of the damaged groundwater conditions along Cileunyi to Rancaekek was due to excessive groundwater extraction in the area. Considering that there are many industrial buildings in the Rancaekek area , this does not rule out being the cause. However, continued Rita, it is necessary to further evaluate whether the industry is the cause of the decrease in the groundwater level in Cileunyi to Rancaekek. \"To find out whether the industry is the main cause, further evaluation is needed, because if the industry complies with the groundwater withdrawal regulations set forth in the permit, it should not cause problems,\" he said. His party highlighted the rampant illegal and unlicensed groundwater extraction. \"What must be paid attention to is illegal or unlicensed groundwater extraction which is still rife. Unlicensed drilled wells cannot control the discharge of groundwater pumping, so it has the potential to cause damage to groundwater conditions in an area,\" he concluded.", "Land Acquistion Issues": null, "Specific mention of renewable energy": null, "Mention of environmentally friendly practices": null, "Electric Vehicle (Production Mentioned)": null, "Nickel": null, "Main Industry": "Mixed/General", "Main Industry Notes": "Textile, Food Industry, Warehouse, Cables, Garments, Pharmaceutical, Printing, Laboratorium Equipment, Contractor, Shoe Manufacturer, Laminating, Face Mask Manufacturer", "August 2023 Sentinel Check": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 107.799664, -6.962019 ] } },

One of them that is really of good capacity is the JIIPE Gresik Industrial Estate which has an Electricity Supply Business Area.\n\nAnd if you pay attention, this Industrial Estate which has its own Power Plant like JIIPE has its own advantages compared to other Industrial Estates where electricity is supplied by PLN. One of them is the availability of electricity supply in JIIPE Industrial Estate and the stability of the voltage is more guaranteed and it will not even flicker (even a fraction of a second).\n\nUntil now, it can be said that the reliability of electricity provided by the JIIPEdi Gresik Industrial Estate power plant is very good so that this can be an attraction for private investors engaged in the industry which at all times are highly dependent on the existence of electricity such as steel processing plants, smelters and others.\"\n\n", "Captive Coal Power Plant": null, "Captive Gas Power Plant": 1.0, "Electricity Capacity Notes": "23 MW (Phase 1: Fully developed and available)\nElectricty 250 MW - ready in 2023", "Electricity Capacity (MW)": 23.0, "Planned Electricity Capacity": null, "Estimated Electricity Capacity (MW) (old)": null, "Estimated Electricity Capacity (MW) 10/23/23": null, "Website": "http://www.jiipe.com", "Tenants": "PT Freeport Indonesia, Clariant, PT.

The construction is halfway done, specifically 51.7 percent complete as of the end of December 2022. \n\"So the downstream and upstream sectors would become one. Refining copper domestically would boost the added values for the copper concentrate from the current 95 percent to 100 percent,” Freeport Indonesia president director Tony Wenas told BTV in a recent interview.\n“And also contribute to the EV ecosystem that is currently being built in Indonesia. Copper will play a pivotal role in the EV ecosystem,” Tony said.\nThe $3 billion Manyar Smelter is expected to process 1.7 million tons of copper concentrates a year. Freeport’s existing smelter PT Smelting has an annual capacity of a million tons of copper concentrates. Combined, Freeport Indonesia’s copper concentrate processing capacity can reach 3 million tons a year. Freeport Indonesia claimed the Manyar plant would become the world’s largest single-line smelter. \nThe Manyar Smelter is slated to begin commercial operations in end-2024, marking the end of copper concentrate ore exports from Freeport Indonesia.\" ", "Status (Operational, Operational with Continued Construction, Under Construction, Before Construction, Unclear, Stalled)": "Operational with Continued Construction", "Year Operations Began": 2018.0, "Year Construction Began": null, "Year Founded": null, "Age": 5.0, "Dispute": null, "Dispute Explanation": null, "Legal dispute with Indonesian government": null, "Legal dispute with a company": null, "Dispute with local residents": null, "Worker's rights dispute": null, "Environmental Concerns": null, "Environmental Concerns Explanation": null, "Land Acquistion Issues": null, "Specific mention of renewable energy": "Planned copper smelter to support electric vehicle supply chain.", "Mention of environmentally friendly practices": null, "Electric Vehicle (Production Mentioned)": 1.0, "Nickel": null, "Main Industry": "Other Metals", "Main Industry Notes": "Mining, chemicals, petrochemicals, banking, fertilizer, concrete, food, cooper", "August 2023 Sentinel Check": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 112.607293, -7.086298 ] } },

Meanwhile, KITW has a special status because it holds the status of a National Strategic Project (PSN) in accordance with Presidential Regulation (Perpres) 58 of 2017, so that processing regional permits can be made easier.  Wilmar Project and Technical Director Erik Tjia said that investment growth had indeed slowed down due to the pandemic, but it was predicted that it would soon increase after the economy recovered. He is optimistic that the growing economy will have a positive impact on industrial area businesses.  \"We hope that the value of incoming investment will continue to increase,\" said Erik Tjia in a press conference at KITW, Serang, Banten, Friday (28/10/2022).  \nKITW Serang has made a positive contribution to the region through paying regional taxes, absorbing 70 percent-80 percent of the workforce from local communities, and other multiplier-effects . Erik explained that of the total land reserved for the development of KITW covering an area of ​​800 ha, 200 ha had been utilized for Wilmar's interests, in the form of building factories for cooking oil, rice, margarine, biodiesel, flour, jetties, packaging and employee housing. \nApart from Wilmar, several investors have entered the area, such as Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) and PT Baja Putra Deli.  Erik hopes that with KITW's status as a PSN, it will be easier to obtain permits and support from the central and regional governments to accelerate investment growth.  \"Investment is one of the pillars of economic growth,\" said Erik.  According to the Business Unit Head of PT Multimas Nabati Asahan Serang, Wilmar Tenang Sembiring group, as an industrial area, KITW is equipped with various facilities, such as asphalt roads that have access to toll roads, gas supplies of up to 20 million standard cubic feet per day (million standard cubic feet per day / MMSCFD), electricity supply up to 500 mega watts (MW), water, fiber optics, hydrant systems, waste processing ( incineration plant ), waste water treatment ( water treatment ), public facilities, and railways.  \"We plan to continue developing this area,\" he said Even though it has very adequate facilities, Wilmar still has difficulties regarding vehicle access, especially trucks, from the toll road to the KITW area because there is no direct access. Currently, transport trucks have to pass through small roads and even residential areas to reach KITW.  Tenang further said that another double effect was the absorption of workers, which currently at KITW has reached around 2,000 people, including construction workers.  Erik and Tenang hope that Wilmar's presence at KITW can supply food needs for Indonesia, especially Jabodetabek.\"", "Status (Operational, Operational with Continued Construction, Under Construction, Before Construction, Unclear, Stalled)": "Operational with Continued Construction", "Year Operations Began": 2018.0, "Year Construction Began": null, "Year Founded": 2016.0, "Age": 7.0, "Dispute": null, "Dispute Explanation": null, "Legal dispute with Indonesian government": null, "Legal dispute with a company": null, "Dispute with local residents": null, "Worker's rights dispute": null, "Environmental Concerns": null, "Environmental Concerns Explanation": null, "Land Acquistion Issues": null, "Specific mention of renewable energy": null, "Mention of environmentally friendly practices": null, "Electric Vehicle (Production Mentioned)": null, "Nickel": null, "Main Industry": "Mixed/General", "Main Industry Notes": "Oil and gas, chemicals, steel, gypsum, edible oil, and cement.", "August 2023 Sentinel Check": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 106.088072, -6.004518 ] } },

In a public hearing on Wednesday (15/3/2023), residents revealed that there was a practice of brokering in the land acquisition process so that they suffered losses.\nSayuti, one of the residents, said that as a result of this practice, he only received IDR 100 million in December 2020, for the down payment for the acquisition of his approximately 5,000 square meter land from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa through Rusli, a broker. This value is far from the initially agreed price, namely IDR 1.49 billion.\n\"Even though I have never given any power of attorney to Rusli. \"That's why I keep asking what happens to the remaining payments,\" he said.\nIt was explained that after investigating it, it was later discovered that the management of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa had paid off its obligations through Rusli's savings account, but unfortunately the amount was not as expected, namely only IDR 1.1 billion, which was suddenly rejected by Sayuti.\n“Yes, of course we don't want to. Moreover, there is already an agreement that if the completion process is later than 2020, the price will be adjusted, even though we are not discussing this issue. \"We only demand rights,\" he said.\nRusli was also present at the hearing. In his statement, he said that the emergence of the problem was triggered by pressure on repayment by Sayuti and the payment pattern which was paid in installments and bailed out by individual employees of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa with certain considerations so that the value did not match what Sayuti expected.\n“After continuing to pay in installments for two years, finally I was confused. Because the family didn't want to accept it, they didn't want to return it to Pancapuri, so in the end the money was returned to me. \"Later, if the price is right, then I will give it to my family, this was my mistake at that time,\" said Rusli.\nFrom this brokering practice, Rusli explained that he received a wage of IDR 5 thousand per meter from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa. Furthermore, he even admitted the truth regarding him not holding a power of attorney from Sayuti. This was because his role as a broker for around 50 other land owners had long been known to many residents, long before he had any dealings with Sayuti.\n“Essentially, I admit that I was wrong, and I fully understand the implications of the actions I have committed. In fact, from the start I told the family, if you want to report it to the police, you can. \"If it were me, I wouldn't be running anywhere, in fact it would be clear to see who is playing at Pancapuri,\" he explained.\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of Commission I of the Cilegon DPRD, Masduki, hopes that this issue will reveal the dark veil of the polemic about land acquisition for residents by PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa which has not yet been resolved.\n\"What's even more strange is why Pancapuri can go to him (transact with Rusli), even though he doesn't have a power of attorney. But this is one of the cases, it could be that the previous problem also had a model like this. Well, everything will be revealed as to who the land mafia is, including the 50 residents (facilitated by brokers) who actually need to be investigated, but that's not in our area. It's possible that the polemic that arose at Mount Sugih was because of casuistry like this. \"From Pancapuri, it was completed but not delivered,\" said Masduki.\nUnfortunately, the hearing which was attended by the Regional Financial and Asset Management Agency (BPKAD), the Head of the Legal Section of the Regional Secretariat of Cilegon City, the National Land Agency (BPN) of Cilegon City, Subdistricts and Districts was not also attended by the management of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa.\n\"Even if Pancapuri cannot attend today without news and confirmation, we will invite him back later, and I will coordinate with the leadership,\" explained this PAN politician.\n\nwww.bantennews.co.id, 9/22/22: \"Dozens of residents of the Cilodan Neighborhood RT 18/05 Gunung Sugih Village, Ciwandan District, Cilegon City on Thursday (22/9/2022) blocked an environmental road which has been the access for PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa's heavy vehicle mobility for the development project of PT Chandra Asri Petrochemical ( CAP) 2.\nThe residents had to carry out the action of blocking the road and unfurling a banner containing the demands because it was confirmed that PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa had not completed its obligation to acquire the land belonging to the residents.\n\"The road has been used by Pancapuri for the road project, while my extended family, around 20 of the houses above, have not been released, that doesn't include the families below. We are disturbed by the dust from the project,\" said Dani Adhani (63), a resident to BantenNews.co.id.\nAccording to Dani, his decision was unanimous regarding the acquisition value of approximately 3,000 square meters of land belonging to his family. However, the value offered has not yet received a response from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa.\n“Those who come to us are all brokers, not A1, whose Pancapuri people are. If you are a broker, you know yourself. Meanwhile, if my family has clearly asked for the figure of Rp. 5 million per meter, and that's okay, it doesn't count as house buildings. That's why we are blocking it, so it's better to just close it first,\" he explained.\nAccording to Dani Adhani, the majority of local residents have left their homes after receiving payment for their release from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa. \"All that's left here is my family, along with Haji Ismat's family, Sayani, the others have all been released,\" he said.\nUntil this news was released, the Director of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa, Abraham Sinatrawan, confirmed via his cellphone that he had not responded to calls and WhatsApp messages sent by journalists.\"\n", "Legal dispute with Indonesian government": "0", "Legal dispute with a company": "0", "Dispute with local residents": "1", "Worker's rights dispute": "0", "Environmental Concerns": null, "Environmental Concerns Explanation": null, "Land Acquistion Issues": 1.0, "Specific mention of renewable energy": null, "Mention of environmentally friendly practices": null, "Electric Vehicle (Production Mentioned)": null, "Nickel": null, "Main Industry": "Petrochemical", "Main Industry Notes": null, "August 2023 Sentinel Check": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 106.0253571, -5.995740374 ] } },

The development of the industrial area has been reported to the Central Government through the Kobar Bappeda.\n\"Based on the self-assessment, around 80 percent of the requirements mandated by Law Number 39 of 2009 concerning Special Economic Zones have been fulfilled,\" said Agus.\nAgus added that PT SBI had met with the Governor of Malaysia to open a partnership with Malaysia regarding derivatives from CPO products. Future plans for PT SBI will build a container depot, logistics center, and  will carry out a consortium with Pelindo, PT Wilmar, Jass Marine .\nCentral Kalimantan Bappedalitbang Kaspinor explained, since five years ago assistance from Central Kalimantan Provincial Public Works has entered Kobar Regency to support this KISB, namely the construction of a road from the Pangkalan Lima roundabout to KISB (Regency road assisted by the Province). Around IDR 20 billion is still needed to build roads that are still damaged for approximately 1.3 km.\n\"These coordination meetings and field visits were held in order to speed up the coordination process. Collaboration is easy to say but not easy to implement,\" said Kaspinor.\n\"I have been appointed as Head of the Water Resources Management Coordination Team, Irrigation Team and others from the Center as a result of the area being designated as a development priority by the Center,\" he added.\nTherefore, Kaspinor continued, in order to find out in more detail the conditions and situation in the field, coordination meetings and visits to the regions were also needed in order to synergize the vision of the government, private sector and BUMN, including cooperatives. Pancasila as an ideology is not only memorized, but also must be applied in the life of the nation and state to realize the Pancasila economy.\nKaspinor also said that PT SBI has become one of the leading companies in Central Kalimantan Province. For this reason, the provincial government is very supportive of industrial development. It is hoped that this industry will have an environmental perspective and local wisdom, taking into account water resources and air pollution in anticipation of the impacts that could arise later.\n\"It is hoped that this industry will have a big impact on the people of Central Kalimantan,\" he stated.

In the same place, the iron ore smelter is being revitalized. \"The government continues to push for an increase in biodiesel.\nIn the third week of August 2021, President Jokowi inaugurated a biodiesel factory in the Batulicin City industrial area, Tanah Bumbu Regency, South Kalimantan Province. The factory, which stands on an industrial area of ​​2,000 ha, is directly connected to the beach. The factory processes crude palm oil (CPO) into 1,500 tons of biodiesel per day, and was built with an investment of IDR 2 trillion.\nThe Batulicin biofuel industry is owned by Haji Isam, the popular name of businessman Syamsudin Andi Arsyad, who is known as the richest man and concurrently the coal king of South Kalimantan. ''I am willing to come here because this industry can open up great job opportunities,'' President Jokowi said in his remarks.\nSecond, he continued, the downstream industry can maintain the stability of palm oil prices, both in the domestic and international markets. Palm oil has a wider market. ''That way, the price can be more stable. Don't let our goods be owned, but the market will determine the price,'' said President Jokowi.\nPresident Jokowi also said that the Jhonlin Group's initiative to build a biodiesel factory was a downstream step for raw commodities that had to be encouraged. The head of state also hopes that PT Jhonlin and other business groups can conduct downstream activities more broadly. ''Either used as cooking oil, cosmetics, or other finished goods. I appreciate what PT Jhonlin Group has done, which certainly provides great added value,' said Jokowi...\nIndustrial area\nIn his report to President Jokowi, Commissioner of PT Jhonlin Agro Raya Andi Amran Sulaiman, (former Indonesian Minister of Agriculture 2014-2019), said that the biodiesel industry in Batulicin, with all its supporting industries upstream, can absorb up to 20,000 workers. There are thousands of others who are indirectly related to the industrial business.\nIt is also believed that the biodiesel industry will revive the prestige of the dim Batulicin Industrial Area. The industrial area itself is part of the PT Jhonlin Group business. According to Amran, the smelter will operate again in the area which will process iron sand (iron rock) into iron billets for the steel industry. The raw material for iron sand and iron stone itself is quite a lot in South Kalimantan, especially on Derawan Island, Sebuku Island, besides there are many others available in Central Sulawesi.\nThe smelter industry Amran Sulaiman refers to belongs to PT Meratus Jaya Iron and Steel (MJIS), a joint venture between two BUMNs, namely PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk and PT Aneka Tambang Tbk . The smelter operated for several years before closing in 2015 due to falling steel prices on the market. Occupying an area of ​​120 ha in Batulicin, the smelter owned by PT Meratus Jaya is currently being revitalized and is expected to return to production in 2023.\nThe Batulicin Industrial Area is one of 120 industrial areas in Indonesia, and the only one in South Kalimantan. It is not surprising that the South Kalimantan Provincial Government and Tanah Bumbu Regency Government have encouraged the industrial area to continue to develop.\nCurrently, Kotabaru Port in Batulicin has entered the sea highway network, and is one of 33 ports in the sea highway network equipped with Inaportnet 4.0 infrastructure. Kotabaru Port has also been equipped with warehouses, passenger terminals, container terminals, and can serve ships with large tonnages. Bersujud Airport in Batulicin City also has a runway that is 1,850 meters long, only an additional 100-200 meters is needed for Boeing 737s to land on it.\nHowever, compared to those standing in East Kalimantan, the Batulicin Industrial Area is still quiet. Apart from the biodiesel factory, cooking oil factory and iron ore smelter which are currently being restored using the latest technology, the Batulicin Industrial Area is only inhabited by a handful of medium-scale factories. PT Jhonlin Group, for example, also operates a rubber and wood pellet processing industry, from wood industry waste, which is used as fuel for heating stoves in four-season homes. The wood pellets are exported to Europe.\nThere are still many industries that can be accommodated. The need for clean water for industry is easy to obtain. Electricity supply is also available in sufficient quantities, available from the Barito power grid, with the back pole of the Bengkanai PLTG in Central Kalimantan.\nPresident Jokowi also reminded the importance of upholding the commitment to abandon fossil energy and switch to new, renewable energy. Therefore, the President encouraged biodiesel production to continue to be increased. Andi Amran Sulaiman, as the Main Commissioner of PT Jhonlin Agro Raya, has invited industry players to enter Batulicin.\nThe biodiesel industry itself will continue to develop in the country. 'In 2021, our target is to be able to produce and distribute 9.2 million kiloliters, and I hope that next year it can increase even higher,\" said President Jokowi.

The $2bn project is expected to consume at least 6mn t/yr of coal to produce 1.8mn t/yr of methanol once operational, Bumi said.\nThe new gasification facility will be built at the Batuta Chemical Industrial Park (BCIP) located in Bengalon, east Kalimantan, Bumi added. The area is currently undergoing the second stage of land clearing in preparation for actual construction of the plant to begin. The facility is targeted for completion by late 2025 or early 2026.\nUnder an initial agreement by both companies, Bumi will supply coal for the facility through its Kaltim Prima Coal (KPC) mining subsidiary and its Ithaca Resources' Kaltim Nusantara Coal subsidiary. Both companies will be responsible for the offtake of the methanol produced, while Air Products will be the builder, owner, and operator of the facility.\nIndonesia's energy ministry (ESDM) welcomed the development of the new gasification facility, saying that these types of projects will help accelerate investments in the growing downstream coal sector.\nInvestments remain low because of the significant financial undertaking needed, as well as the lack of an existing market for coal derivative products, the ESDM said. The ESDM is hoping that the commercial operations of two large-scale coal gasification plants will demonstrate the economic feasibility of the downstream coal sector to industry players.\nThe methanol produced by the plant is expected to help reduce imports, and increase the value of lower-quality coal produced in Indonesia.\"\n\nmediakaltim.com, 4/26/2022: A coal-to-methanol processing plant will soon be built in Kutim\n\"The government has started the construction of a coal gasification industry into dimethyl ether (DME) in East Kutai. The downstream industry for processing black gold into methanol is targeted to be completed in 2024. Academics have requested that policy makers prioritize local workers in this project.\nTo kaltimkece.id mediakaltim.com network, Tuesday, April 19 2022, the Head of the One-Stop Investment and Integrated Services Service (DPMPTSP), Puguh Harjanto, reported the progress of the construction of the coal gasification industry. Currently, the work is entering the land clearing stage at the Batuta Chemical Industrial Park (BCIP), Bengalon, East Kutai.\n\"We are currently in the second phase of the land clearing process. The construction has already been prepared,\" said Puguh when met at the Odah Etam Hall, Samarinda.\nFor information, the gasification project is being undertaken by PT Bakrie Capital Indonesia (BCI) and PT Ithaca Resources and Air Products from the United States. The project value is around USD 2 billion or IDR 30 trillion (exchange rate IDR 14,900/USD). If this project is completed, PT Bumi Resources TBK (BUMI) through its subsidiary, PT Kaltim Prima Coal, will become the supplier of the coal needs. The projected amount of coal is 6 million tons per year.\n\"This is included in the downstream strategy and increasing added value. God willing, we will control it,\" Puguh added.\nStill at the Odah Etam Hall, the East Kutai Regent, Ardiansyah, confirmed that the construction of a methanol processing plant is underway in his area. The project belongs to BCIP. Based on information received by Ardiansyah, the construction is targeted to be completed in 2024. Ardiansyah ensures that the project's development documents, such as an environmental impact analysis (Amdal), are complete and meet standards.\n\"It is impossible for land clearing to start without an EIA, how dare they,\" said the Regent.\"\n\n\n9/21/2021, Bisnis.com: \"The East Kutai Regency (Kutim) government has conducted an evaluation regarding the development of institutional management of the Maloy Batuta Trans Kalimantan Special Economic Zone (KEK).

Batuta Chemical Industrial Park. The development is situated on the coastline of Makassar Strait and is planned to establish an integrated industrial development, which stimulates profitable business, especially for the coal industry. As a new profitable industrial park development, this project has three main success factors for the development strategy to establish a comprehensive industrial park. \nFirst, the development shall provide an integrated infrastructure network. Second, the development shall accommodate a self-sustained industrial estate development, and third, the development shall be planned to be the center of excellence in new coal processing.\nThe realization of these success factors requires the implementation of design principles that create a clear and functional development structure, flexible land parcels, green and blue infrastructure, and efficient phasing on the clustering.\nHalf of the approximately 943,8 hectares land area is designed to serve industrial programs. These programs are clustered based on coal processing and are part of Industrial Land, which will be sold out to investors. On the other hand, the Small Medium Enterprise (SME) area, which is part of the Industrial Building, will be rented out.\nTo enhance the feature as an integrated industrial park development, parts of the land area are also planned to support the industrial programs, such as commercial and public facilities, public amenities, potential transportation facilities (port), and a government office. More than 10% of the land area is covered by green area.

Where, the management of the MBTK KEK is managed by two regional governments, namely the East Kalimantan Provincial Government and the East Kutai Regency Government.\nTherefore, while the process is underway, PT MBTK, which is collaborating with two investors in developing the Maloy SEZ, namely PT Energi Agro Investama (EAI) and PT Palma Serasih Internasional, will have its status upgraded to become a regionally owned enterprise (BUMD).\n\"All of this is so that investors who have entered will not experience difficulties in developing their businesses in the Maloy KEK,\" said East Kalimantan Provincial Secretary Sri Wahyuni ​​when witnessing the signing of the Cooperation Agreement (PKS) between PT MBTK and PT EAI in the East Kalimantan Provincial Secretary's meeting room. , East Kalimantan Governor's Office, Jalan Gajah Mada Samarinda, Monday 31 July 2023.\nFurthermore, when PT MBTK's status increases, it is hoped that more investors will also enter. Thus, supporting the economic growth of the people of the Etam Continent. Moreover, the development of the Maloy SEZ also synergizes in supporting the development of the Archipelago Capital Region (IKN).\nThis means that when this status increases, investors will automatically become more confident in investing their capital in East Kalimantan Province, especially in the Maloy SEZ. \n\"Because, our biggest homework in East Kalimantan is how to realize downstream development in special economic zones, including the Maloy SEZ. \"Hopefully, with the increasing status, there will be more downstreaming in the Maloy KEK,\" he hoped.\"\n\nkalimantan.bisnis.com, 7/31/2023: Entering New Investors, MBTK KEK Canceled With Status Revoked?\n\"The Maloy Batuta Trans Kalimantan Special Economic Zone (SEZ) (MBTK) in East Kutai Regency has succeeded in avoiding the threat of revoking its status from the KEK National Council. This is after KEK MBTK received a new investor, namely PT Energi Agro Investama, which is engaged in the downstream processing industry of Crude Palm Oil (CPO). The cooperation agreement between MBTK and PT Energi Agro Investama was signed on Monday (31/7/2023) at the East Kalimantan Governor's Office and witnessed by the East Kalimantan Provincial Secretary (Sekdaprov). East Kalimantan Provincial Secretary Sri Wahyuni ​​stated that with this new investor, KEK MBTK has fulfilled the investment plan requirements set by the KEK Supervisory Board.\n\"This signing is a plan to build a refinery and in the future there will be biodiesel with an investment value of IDR 800 billion,\" he said in Samarinda, Monday (31/8/2023). According to him, PT Energi Agro Investama will build a palm oil derivative processing industry in the MBTK KEK in five stages.\nThis company is also claimed to be the first company to build a CPO downstream industry in East Kalimantan, after previously having a similar industry in Sumatra. \"We appreciate that there is a second tenant filling the Maloy KEK. \"This is a good prospect, this company also has the same industry in Sumatra, so this is the first in East Kalimantan,\" explained Sri.

Thus, KEK, which is included in the industrial sector with the main activities of palm oil processing, energy, wood processing and logistics, has considered its performance to be not optimal. Still quoted from the document above, the MBTK KEK with an area of ​​557.34 hectares has received government support from APBN and APBD funds for its operational and development activities. Several ministries and state institutions have also provided commitments to support the MBTK KEK in 2022...\"\n\njehajjhatulistiwa.co.id, 2/13/2023: Four MBTK KEK Supporting Sectors Not ready to Operate\n\"East Kutai - Currently the port that the people of East Kutai (Kutim) Maloy Batuta Trans Kalimantan (MBTK) has been waiting for to support the regional economy has not been fully developed. This is because there are still problems that must be met. This area has an area of 557 hectares which is divided into three districts, namely Bengalon, Kaliorang, and Sangkulirang.\nMet by tracekhatulistiwa.co.id journalists Head of the One-Stop Integrated Investment and Licensing Service (DPMPTSP), Tegu Budi Santoso explained that there are four sectors that should support activities in KEK Maloy namely the oil palm plantation sector, the timber industry, the energy industry sector and the energy industry sector. logistics.\n\"\"Well, the four sectors are dettermed by PP or Presidental Decree. However, it is possible that other sectors will grow from the four sectors as long as the investment value is above IDR 100 billion,\"\" Teguh explained in his office, Monday (13/02/22). [Correction: posted on February 13, 2023]. Furthermore, he said that the four sectors had not yet fully operated due to inadequate port facilities.\n\"\"If it's clear for the port, it's only the problem with other facilities, right? Of course, the MBTK Development and Management Business Agency will appoint a port amangement agency, we don't know who will be appointed,\"\" he said.\nThen, Teguh said that currently only the oil palm planataion industrial sector had invested. This has been done by making a MOU between the Kutim Regency Goverment (Pemkab) of Kutim and PT. Palma Serasih Internasional (PSI) with an investment of IDF 55 billion.\n\"\"In addition to having built a Bulking Station (CPO storage tank), Palma Serasih is still engaged in the upstream sector and will add planations. Now, if the garden meets the needs of the Bulking Station, then the refinery will be given,\"\" he concluded.\nMeanwhile, the Head of the Shipping Diviion (Kabid) of the East Kalimantan Province (Kaltim) Transportation Service (Dishub), Ahmad Maslihuddin said. So far, the role of the East Kalimantan Provincial Trasporation Agency is still focused on completed the approach raod to the Maloy causeway at the the international port.\n\"\"The approach road already exists, but thre road passes through the KEK Malo offices, so it is not a good road to use as an approach road. Therefore it is necessary to make a new approach road, towards the main route, so that it does not interfere with office activities. The approach raod is only about 300 meters and will pass behind the office,\"\" he said.\nIt is planned that the approach raod will be completd in 2023. Apart from focusing on completing the approach road, the East Kalimantan Transportation Agency is intensely overseeing the operational permit for KEK Maloy at the Ministry of Transporation.\"\n\nindagkio.kaltimprov.go.id: \"Infrastructure: The road in the area is 11.44 km long, the progress of 3.25 km has been rigid\nDrinking Water Treatment System (SPAM) Maloy 1 x 200 L/d\nTemporary electricity supply of 2 MW, originating from PLTD Sangkulirang is channeled through SUTM 20 kV\nTelecommunications towers have been built, Telkom and Telkomsel will soon install and strengthen the internet and telecommunication networks\nLand Side Office/Port Buildings have been built including Administrator Offices, BUPP, Workshops, Mosques, PMK Buildings\"\n\npro.kutaitimurkab.go.id, 12/22/2022: The Government of Kutim Regency Supports the Improvement of KEK MBTK - New Strategy, Focus on Program Support is Already Underway\n\"...In the coordination meeting, East Kalimantan Sesprov Sri Wahyuni at the beginning of the meeting asked BUPP KEK MBTK to present the latest developments in the area that was formerly called KIPI (Industrial Zone and International Port) Maloy. In the presentation it was concluded that the KEK MBTK by the relevant ministry fully surrendered the fate of the area in question. Is it continued or stopped.\nAll participants in the coordination meeting agreed that the area which as the potentail to develop as an integrated industrial area will continue. Of course, with a new strategy that is capable in all aspects.\n\"\"A detailed investment opportunity map is needed. So investors who want to enter can already calculate when the BEP (break even point/return on investment, ed), calculate the benefit profile. So that Maloy can be promoted more with the potential for a better investment plan,\"\" said Sri Wahyuni.\nSesprov explained that the coordination meeting this time was an evaluation related to KEK MBTK. So that the acceleration becomes faster. Moreover, according to Presidential Regulation Number 8 of 2022, the Head of the Special Economic Zone Secretariat is Sesprov. Therefore, he said a new adjustment is needed. In terms of structure, the focus of the program is to solve problems such as infraustructure, assets, and clean water. Until finally KEK MBTK actually operates.\nGradually adjusting the management and administration of the area is being addressed. Priority infrastructure needs such as roads outside the area to Maloy can be representative. Especially the national road leading there. Securing 509 hectares in Maloy to the need for clean water so that the industry in the area can run.\nSpecifically for land, clean water and other issues, the Development Economic Assistant to the Secretary of Zubair regency requested that the manager send a letter to the East Kutai Regency Government...While other needs such as clean water should be addressed immediately or find other alternatives as a solution. Regarding the availability of land that belongs to the East Kutai Regency Government, it is also safe. Including the land acquisition that is hindering the construction of the road to Maloy, it has been completed. So that construction of roads that had stopped can be resumed.\nThe conclusion of this coordination meeting, the chairperson of the meeting asked the parties to focus on programs or something that was already running. Issuing a legal umbrella to support the relevant Presidential Decree. Next, efforts to preen KEK MBTK so that investors are interested are also requested to be increased. Of course, by compiling a complete master plan. Plus investment potential and industrial clusters.

This action sparked a reaction of resistance from opposing labor groups. As a result, clashes were inevitable.\nHundreds of police officers intervened to mediate between the two warring camps.\nThe workers' strike action was to urge the management of PT VDNI and PT OSS to provide family allowances, transportation allowances and housing allowances to workers. The workers also asked the company to carry out Collective Labor Agreement (PKB) negotiation procedures in accordance with Minister of Manpower Regulation (Permenaker) No. 28 of 2014, and urged the central management leadership to remove the HRD position of PT. OSS and PT. VDNI in Morosi.\nFor your information, these two nickel refining companies, PT VDNI and PT OSS, are located in the Morosi industrial area. PT VDNI was founded in 2014 and is a subsidiary of De Long Nickel Co Ltd which originates from Jiangsu, China. This company invested tens of trillions of rupiah to build a smelter facility with modern technology. Its production capacity is 600,000-800,000 tons of nickel pig iron per year. Until the end of 2018, PT VDNI had contributed US$142.2 million to Indonesian exports.\nThe parent companies of PT OSS are Hong Kong Xiangyu Hansheng Co Ltd and Singapore Xiangyu Hansheng Pte Ltd. This company was founded in 2016 in an area of ​​398 hectares with an investment value of US$ 2 billion. Since 2018, this company has applied for a principle permit to build a 400,000 ton stainless steel production facility, 800,000 ton steel lab and 800,000 ton ferronickel. To date, PT OSS has built 17 smelter furnaces out of the planned 30 furnaces.\nMeanwhile, Arys Nirwana, Head of Human Resources Department PT VDNI and PT OSS, in his release explained that what was conveyed by the action participants did not match the facts. This is because, for example, the company has good intentions and is open to discussing this matter as long as the labor union fulfills the requirements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\nIn every meeting held at the company, at the Konawe Regency Manpower Office and the Provincial DPRD Hearing Meeting, the company complied with the summons and acted cooperatively.\nFor wage demands, the company's payroll system refers to statutory regulations and company regulations/policies. Employees can check this on their respective pay slips, instead of referring to a website that doesn't know who made it. The actions of the trade unions which use this as a reason for the strike are baseless.\n\"In the previously circulated action circular, the things conveyed in the notification letter are untrue, unfounded, and tend to provoke and disturb company employees who intend to work seriously to support their families and to develop their abilities and competencies. as well as professionalism in work,\" he explained.

When Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry built the smelter there eight years ago, people from around Morosi went there hoping to make money. Economic opportunities grew when Obsidian Stainless Steel officially opened a nickel smelter last year. The two companies are subsidiaries of Xiangyu and the Delong Group, a Chinese business alliance. Obsidian has a production capacity of over 2.5 million tons of nickel per year. Virtue Dragon has a production capacity of over 1 million tons annually. Those two factories produce nickel pig iron (NPI), ferronickel, and nickel matte. Those three nickel ore products are components for making steel. As of the third quarter of 2021, Obsidian exported over 800,000 tons of NPI worth Rp24.5 trillion. Virtue Dragon exported 618,117 metric tons worth Rp17 trillion over that same period. In addition to stimulating the economy outside the factory gates, those two large smelters provide a lot of jobs. La Ode Muhammad Alihaswandy, Chief of the Office of Transmigration and Labor of Southeast Sulawesi, said that out of 25,281 workers at those two smelters, 1,893 are from China. “The mining sector accounts for 2.9 percent of workers,” he said. According to Alihaswandy, the opening of shops is but one domino effect from the construction of nickel smelters in Morosi. Residents rent out boarding rooms or houses, open restaurants, workshops, and other commercial facilities. Newly built shops sprouted up along the road in Morosi... The growth in economy in Southeast Sulawesi due to this nickel mining activity has created a new problem: trash accumulation. In addition to the high amount of street dust and smoke resulting from the burning of coal to power the ore processing plant, trash scatters on the streets around the market or vendor shops, and is even found in the river and swamps. It appears that the local government has not made any plans in response to the impact of this sudden economic change. While most of the vendors come from outside of Morosi, locals tend to become factory workers or work side jobs in addition to their company jobs. Residents of Mandiodo, Tapuemea, and Tapunggaya villages no longer work as fishermen. They have gone to work in the factories or have taken up nickel mining. According to Ratna Kasim, head of neighborhood unit (RT) 4 in Tapunggaya village, of the 32 heads of households in her area only two still remain as fishermen. Her husband is paid Rp3 million a month as a security guard for heavy machinery located at the mining location. “Everything has grown with nickel,” she said, pointing to the houses with cars in the garages. Before the nickel mining, houses in her neighborhood had wood walls and sago palm frond roofing. Nearly no one can endure to work as fisherman in the villages located around the nickel mining location. Ratna said that the waters are contaminated with nickel slurry. Fishing platforms are often destroyed when barges in Tapunggaya Bay crash into them. As a result, fishers must search for daily catch further out at sea, making it more expensive to sail. “It is difficult to find fish now,” she said. Amirudin is one of two heads of households in RT 4 in Tapunggaya who remains to be a fisherman. He confirmed Ratna’s story. According to him, fish catches have been getting smaller since nickel mining started. Sometimes he catches 10 kilograms of fish a night, which are sold in the market for Rp200,000. “Before the nickel mining, my income was Rp600,000 a night,” he said. This is also the case in Mandiodo village. Slamet Riadi, the local village head, said that of the 239 heads of households in his area, perhaps only about 10 percent are still fishermen. Slamet explained that in addition to having difficulty catching fish, working in the factory is more promising. “It used to be easy to catch fish and difficult to sell them. Now it is easy to sell them but you have to go far out to catch them,” he said. In addition to earning wages working at the nickel smelter, residents in villages receive compensation from each company for the dust issue. In Mandiodo village, said Slamet, each family receives Rp1.5 million in compensation per month. This was an agreement reached between local communities and the company. According to him, the air became polluted after the nickel smelter went into operation, and conditions are particularly bad during the dry season. However, during the rainy season the dust dissipates but Mandiodo is inundated by mud, something which had never previously occurred in this village. In early December 2022, the entire Mandiodo village was inundated with mud mid-calf deep. According to Slamet, the mud ran down from the hills around Mandiodo that have become barren due to nickel mining. “Nickel gives life to the economy, but it destroys the environment,” he said.\"\n\nEnvironmental Justice Atlas, 4/10/2022: \"Residents that live close to Delong Nickel Smelter began to complain about the pollution from coal dust after the coal-fired power plants began operation [7].

In 2019, there was a massive flood that hit the Bahodopi area. In September 2019, hundreds of residents took to the streets in Dampala Village in the Bahodopip district, about 7 kilometers away from the IMIP, as a result of the lack of satisfying response from mining companies after the flood that hit the three villages of Dampala, Le Le and Siumbatu on 8 June 2019 [28]. The flood disaster claimed the lives of two residents and hundreds of houses, as well as public facilities. Residents that are members of the Aliansi Rakyat Menggugat (Armet) claimed that the cause of the flood was related to the nickel mining activities upstream of the village, and demanded a review of the environmental impact assessment (Amdal) document of PT Bintang Delapan Mineral (BDM) and revoking the company of its mining business license (MBL) [21]. It was reported that the flood did not affect the operation of the IMIP, but cut off some workers from their workplace due to the collapse of bridges and road. The Morowali Police Chief ended up coordinating the negotiation between the protesters and the local government, who promised to compensate the local residents for their loss and evaluate the MBL holders such as BDM [18], [28]. In November and December 2021, demonstrations were held by student group Aliansi Mahasiswa dan Masyarakat Morowali (AMMM) and consumer group Aliansi Pelanggan Listrik Menggugat (Pelita) Morowali respectively to request for solving the local electricity crisis, as local residents suffered from frequent blackouts.[29] While the demonstration was more targeting the local government and electricity provider PLN, the electricity shortage at the local communities is in direct contrast with the scale of coal-fired power plants built by the IMIP that provides electricity supply to its industrial operations. In fact, the IMIP allocated most of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) budget to electricity subsidies to address the community electricity shortage in the Bahodopi district, including Fatufia, Keurea, Bahodopi and Bahomakmur villages [30]. It was reported that the construction of the CFPP at the IMIP helped with the electricity access in the area, especially with the subsidies from the company. However, PLN did not continue the collaboration with the IMIP and used diesel power instead [31].\"\n\nLabor Issues:\nEnvironmental Justice Atlas, 7/5/2022: \"Labor conditions is another major issue at the IMIP that has been voiced by multiple organizations. It is perceived by local workers that the Chinese peers tend to given higher wages and some of the Chinese workers were hired illegally, which led to anti-Chinese sentiments and even conflicts from time to time [32]. There were alleged labor malpractices such as termination of contracts, long working hours, unfair wages, and restrictions due to COVID-19, as well as high incident and fatality rate [7], [32], [33]. In a most recent case, “leading activists of the United Labour and People’s Alliance, which consists of three labor unions, the Morowali Industrial Workers Union (SPIM), the Morowali Indonesian Prosperous Labour Union (SBSI), and the Morowali Indonesian National Federation of Workers’ Unions (FSPNI), were dismissed unilaterally on 14 August 2020 by the management of the company due to their union activity in the pandemic time [34].” This incident started from a series of interactions between the Alliance and the company at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, where 2,000 workers were sent home or told to quarantine. On 5 August 2020, the Alliance held a demonstration in front of the IMIP office, which led to a mediation meeting between the Alliance and the IMIP coordinated by the government through the Bahodopi sub-district secretary (Sekcam). On 14 August, three union leaders joined a meeting with the management of PT Indonesia Tsingshan Stainless Steel (ITSS) and PT Bukit Smelter Indonesia (BSI), which ended up with a unilateral dismissal of the three union leaders in the name of provoking colleagues to hold demonstrations and disrupting/hindering production. The layoff of union leaders later led to a strike of three days between 22 and 25 August 2020 [34].\"", "Legal dispute with Indonesian government": "0", "Legal dispute with a company": "0", "Dispute with local residents": "1", "Worker's rights dispute": "1", "Environmental Concerns": 1.0, "Environmental Concerns Explanation": "Deforestation, water pollution, damage to local farms, respiratory infections\nEnvironmental Justice Atlas, 7/5/2022: \"The Bahodopi district is home to 12 villages, including 4 villages most directly affected by the IMIP, namely Bahodopi, Keurea, Fatufia and Bahomakmur [9]. Local NGOs such as AEER, JATAM and Yayasan Tanah Merdeka (YTM) have been raising the issues regarding the environmental and social impact of the IMIP, including the nickel mining activities and the CFPPs [20]. An academic article also documented different forms of conflicts involving various stakeholders in the nickel mining area in and around the IMIP based on interviews and questionnaires, especially the conflicts between migrant communities and local residents, and between local residents and companies [9]. The often mentioned impacts include the degradation of forests, rivers and coastal zones in the neighborhood, the impact on local farmers’ livelihood, and the health impact on the local residents [18]. It was reported that acute respiratory infection (ARI) is a common issue for local residents, including kids, in the Bahodopi district [18], [21].

Environmental group WALHI of Central Sulawesi also conducted an investigation and found environmental impacts on local communities.\n\nHak Cipta: \"On March 3, 2022, the people of Tanauge Village, Petasia District, North Morowali Regency demonstrated a demonstration against the company that manages the Nickel Industrial Estate, namely PT Stardust Estate Investment and its tenant company that manages the smelter factory, namely PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry.\nThe reason for the residents' protests was the company's activities which were considered to be narrowing the space for fishermen to find fish, as well as other activities that could interfere with people's health and comfort. The types of activities in question are beach reclamation, barge loading and unloading activities, giant mast erection activities, land acquisition, and smelter activities.\nAccording to residents of Tanauge, the reclamation of the coast will turn the coast and waters into artificial land. PT Stardust has reclaimed the beach for the construction of a 15 hectare jetty. And it is expected to increase again. For jetty construction activities where they are reclaiming the beach it will be used for loading and unloading ships to dock.\nMeanwhile, several barges and the like have been seen crossing the waters around the administrative area of ​​Tanauge Village. According to the Head of Tanauge Village, Abdillah, the distance from Stardust's Jetty to Tanauge Village is 2 km. Likewise with the piles that are in the waters causing fishermen to go to sea because of the presence of these piles.\nOf all the activities in the coastal and water areas by Stardust, it has narrowed the fishing area for fishermen and has damaged fisherman's FADs.\nRegarding the issue of land acquisition, the company that manages the Nickel Industrial Estate, Stardust Estate Investment, does not provide disclosure of land acquisition data to the people of Tanauge. The village government and the people who staged the demonstration asked for all data on claims for land acquisition by Stardust, however, through Public Relations who met the demonstrating communities, they said that the company had paid compensation and would not do it again. While there are still people who have not received compensation.\nThis is the current problem in Tanauge Village regarding land acquisition and compensation.\nFor smelter factories, residents of Tanauge asked for a suspension. This is because it is feared that smelter smoke entering the Tanauge Village area will cause air pollution and can affect the health of residents. The community asked the smelter manager, namely Gunbuster, to provide and open permit documents for factory management that comply with environmental requirements.\"\n\nUnfair land acquisition practices:\nhttps://projectmultatuli.org/, 05/07/2023: \"...Wahono has rice fields and oil palm plantations. Rice fields covering an area of ​​1 ha, oil palm plantations covering an area of ​​4 ha. Both are now no longer productive because the water never recedes.\nThe oil palm plantation is included in the PT GNI area. Apart from Wahono, there are around 37 ha of transmigrant land that is included in the industrial area. On average, residents have 2 ha of land. There are some who have 1 ha, there are also 6 ha.\nTheir land is now part of a \"national vital object\". Access for residents is difficult. The gates of PT GNI are closely guarded by security forces, from company security officers, police, to soldiers.\nResidents asked for compensation, including Wahono. However, PT GNI appreciates it with a land acquisition value of IDR 15 thousand/m² or IDR 150 million/ha. In fact, in 2019, the release price was IDR 2,500/m² or IDR 25 million/ha.\nWahono objected to the price.\nHe set the price of his land at IDR 50 thousand/m² or IDR 500 million/ha, taking into account that PT GNI sunk his oil palm plantations. But, the company refused.\n“But, their tricks are good. They drowned [the palm trees]. \"Finally, it became unproductive land,\" complained Wahono.\nWahono offered a middle way: asking PT GNI to help residents whose rice fields and gardens were sinking by converting them into ponds.\nPT GNI can lend tools and fuel to raise the embankments, providing a path for fish to descend to the empang. That way, said Wahono, society also has economic movement.\nHowever, the company ignored this proposal.\nWahono couldn't stay silent. Land as a source of livelihood for his family is a matter of life and death. And, as transmigrants, their land is limited.\nWahono tried to find another way. To get the company's attention, he closed the road in front of his house, the road used by PT GNI for motorized vehicles going in and out of the company.\nHowever, instead of listening to residents' complaints, PT GNI sent security forces to their homes. Police and soldiers came and opened the way. Wahono couldn't move.\nFinally, Wahono took the initiative to make a new excavation so that the river could flow. After complaining to the regent's office, DPRD and local police, the government lobbied PT GNI to allow Wahono to borrow tools to dig.\nWahono worked on it for two months.\nAnd, it's proven.

They just closed.”\nWahono complained to the Governor of Central Sulawesi, Rusdy Mastura.

Unfair land acquistion practices.\nhttps://projectmultatuli.org/, 05/07/2023: \"SINCE PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry (GNI) operated a smelter factory, Wahono and his family complained that the heat of the sun was no longer friendly. At the same time, the surface of the land around his house in Bunta Village, North Morowali, never dries out.\nThe plants lined up in front of the stilt house looked dry and covered in dust. The PT GNI industrial area is located about 10 km from his house. Dust from the factory flies around and sticks to the plants.\nUnder the house on stilts, black-brown water pooled and wet household utensils. The stagnant water smells and makes you itchy, said Wahono, who lives with his wife and three children, the youngest 6 months old, and his in-laws.\nPT GNI needs water as a coolant for coal power plants to meet the needs of nickel processing and refining facilities ( smelters ) in the area. The company takes water from the Koro Lamoito river—residents usually call it the Lampi River—by blocking the residents' river flow. As a result, river water overflowed into residential areas and flooded roads.\nTo overcome this, Wahono raised the ground surface of the house and around the house with sand and stones. The plan is that he will build a boarding house on the land next to his house.\nWahono is a transmigrant from Ponorogo, East Java, whose parents brought him in when he was 17 years old in 1996. The New Order government provided 1 ha of land for the transmigrants to work on rice fields. In total, there were 132 families from Java who took part in the transmigration program. Wahono remembers that the army was closely monitoring the process of farmers planting rice fields.\nHowever, the Indonesian government also rolled out the red carpet for two corporations coming to North Morowali, which are slowly evicting the transmigrants' land.\nThe first company was the palm oil plantation PT Agro Nusa Abadi (ANA), a subsidiary of PT Astra Agro Lestari Group, which arrived in 2006. Thirteen years later it was PT GNI.\n\"Companies should come and bring goodness to the community,\" said Wahono.\nWhat happened was just the opposite. Companies come to steal people's land. The company also caused environmental changes, making it impossible for residents to grow crops, residents alleged.\nIn the past, Wahono rice fields used to harvest twice a year. After PT ANA arrived, this company was accused of embanking the rice field planting areas, causing flooding of rice fields and residential areas. Wahono can only harvest rice once a year during the dry season.\nThen, when PT GNI closed the river flow, the water overflowed even more. Both the dry season and the rainy season, the land is submerged. Wahono couldn't harvest at all.\nIt felt, for Wahono, like being pranked by the state. \"I also know that [investment] is between countries,\" said Wahono, referring to PT GNI. “But we are the hosts. No matter how small we are.”\n'To and fro the water'\nThe main road in Bunta Village is the route for PT GNI workers' motorized vehicles and trucks entering and exiting the company. The road is now full of holes. Every time it rains heavily, the holes are flooded. Part of the ground surface of the house on the side of the road was also submerged in water.\nIn April 2023, floods submerged Bunta Village. The water almost touched the floor of the Wahono stilt house.\nIn 2019, shortly after PT GNI built a nickel smelter area, flooding also occurred. That year was the first time people's houses were flooded for three months. Land transportation was cut off. PT GNI workers, who go to work via the Bunta Village road, also have to use boats.\nIt is true that there is usually a flood every five years in Bunta Village. However, since PT GNI came to close the river, the impact of the flooding has become worse, residents said.\nThe flood never stopped completely. Even in summer, residential land remains flooded with water.\n\"We can't stand it. \"To and fro the water,\" said Wahono.\nWahono has rice fields and oil palm plantations.

Stardust Estate Investment (SEI) and PT. Gun Buster Nickel Industry (GNI) in North Morowali Regency (Morut).\nChairman of the WALHI Regional Council for Central Sulawesi, Richard Labiro, said that we found facts and this has become a problematic issue in the community, especially Bunta Village, East Petasia District and Tanauge Village, Petasia District, North Morowali Regency (Morut)...\nHe said that the impact they found was that from an environmental perspective, the existence of a steam power plant (PLTU), residents of Hamlet 5, Bunta Village were exposed to Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) resulting from burning coal.\n\"And in the early morning, residents there feel fog, but it's not the usual fog like before company activities,\" he said.\nAlthough he said, there has been no impact felt by local communities such as ISPA and others, but vulnerable groups who are threatened include mothers, the elderly and children.\nApart from that, he said, due to the company filling up the Lampi River, when it rains even a little, the Lampi River water overflows into the settlements, plantations, rice fields and livestock of the residents of V Transmigration Hamlet, Bunta Village.\n“Even though the company is responsible for this. But it doesn't solve the problem. \"The company excavated land in the area to fill in flooded roads,\" he explained.\nHe said, regarding the incident of water overflowing into residential areas and others, local residents had reported it to the Governor of Central Sulawesi, but until now there had been no solution.\nMeanwhile, the impact felt by Tanauge residents, he explained, was that compensation was not transparent and the payment was not open, there was no socialization of compensation prices to the community from the previous local government.\nApart from that, according to him, the agreement on the area for the construction of the Jetty between the company and the residents changed at the beginning when it was agreed that the area was 15 hectares, but as time went by it was suspected that the area would be more than 15 hectares.\n\"So the water area has been privatized by the company to build a ring road,\" he said.\nEven for the activities of barges and towing barges for parking in front of residential areas, there is a price set by the company to be paid to the community, but the payment is not enjoyed by the residents, due to problems with the local village government.\n\"On the other hand, the local community is worried that their availability of clean water will be affected due to the expansion of the company area,\" he said.\nBased on the results of the investigation carried out, he said, Walhi, as an organizer on labor issues, will strengthen residents affected by the company's activities.

At least the level of environmental pollution from industrial waste can be minimized.\n\"The question then is, why is the problem of environmental pollution in this area still occurring and is still occurring to this day. \"This means that there is something wrong with the waste management there, and to what extent the supporting budget for this has been used, whether it has been maximized and according to its intended purpose, or are you sure it is on target,\" explained Kadir.\nHe also questioned the implementation of the vision and mission by PT KIMA, which has a mission for a quality green industrial area and a vision to become a smart, modern and green area management company with the largest output.\n\"This is what PT KIMA must prioritize as the sole manager of the industrial area there. So basically all industrial companies in the area have tenant status. \"They rent tenants or space provided by PT KIMA and of course with supporting facilities including waste management facilities,\" said Kadir.\nHe asked APH to investigate more deeply the SOP for waste management managed by PT KIMA, starting from the inspection process, supervision, capacity or condition of waste storage areas, which of course should change along with the increasing activity of companies renting tenants or premises in the area.\n\"I think the focus should be here because it is related to the use of a very large budget which is related to the problem of environmental pollution due to the alleged impact of waste management which is still poor or not in accordance with existing regulations. \"We are waiting for APH's seriousness in investigating this case,\" Kadir stressed.\nPreviously, in a Hearing Meeting (RDP) discussing the issue of environmental pollution of the Tallo River tributary, Parangloe River, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District, Makassar which was initiated by Commission C of the Makassar City DPRD, a number of important points were revealed.\nOne of them, it was revealed that a number of companies in KIMA had fulfilled their obligation to pay money every month to PT. KIMA as the sole operator in the industrial area is related to waste management.\nThe obligations paid by a number of companies to KIMA are said to vary in value. Some make monthly deposits of IDR 4 million to IDR 5 million, depending on the volume of waste generated from the company's activities in question.\n\"Don't DLH or anyone else blame the companies at KIMA, don't say that PT at that time was like this and like this, the one responsible for the waste conditions at KIMA, not the businessman, he paid,\" said Chairman of Commission C of the Makassar City DPRD, Sangkala Saddiko while leading RDP discussed the issue of pollution of the Tallo River tributary, Parangloe River, Tamalanrea District, Makassar in the Makassar DPRD Banggar Room, Wednesday 17 May 2023.\n“How much does PT Wahyu pay? 4-5 million?. Well, he pays, so if waste like that occurs it is not the entrepreneur's responsibility, the responsibility is PT KIMA because this has been a long-standing problem. \"So where has KIMA been responsible for the past few years?\" Sangkala Saddiko said.\nHe admitted that he was surprised that the Makassar City Environmental Service (DLH), which was also present at the RDP, said that it had carried out inspections and so on. However, the problem of environmental pollution around KIMA is thought to be due to industrial waste still occurring.\n\"If the inspection was carried out intensively then nothing like this would happen. \"I admit that the environment is our partner. I always ask if he proposes regulations like that, but the question is why it still happens like that,\" said Sangkala Saddiko.\n\"Remember, all the entrepreneurs there are making payments, don't accuse this PT, this PT is responsible for the waste, what is clear is that I asked Indofood, I asked Sari Roti and so on, it all comes down to KIMA, because he said PT KIMA oversees waste matters, so \"That's not the responsibility of the entrepreneur, the responsibility is the manager, in this case PT KIMA,\" explained Sangkala Saddiko.\nHe said that he was elected from the Biringkanaya electoral district, Tamalanrea and knows exactly the problems experienced by the community regarding waste.\n\"I once said to the residents, can you still stand a smell like this? \"If it was in accordance with the existing progress, it wouldn't have happened like that. If, for example, it went like that, the entrepreneur at KIMA wanted to carry out his activities well, so he paid to comply with the existing regulations. I was sent proof of their payment,\" Sangkala Saddiko said again.\nHe also admitted that he was a regular road user in Kapasa Raya. That night he passed by and opened his car window. The stench approached.\n\"That's why I asked from the Environmental Service earlier, if the waste mechanism was running, it wouldn't have happened like that and this, sir, I was a member of the DPRD for two terms and passed by there every day, last night, sir, when I opened the glass door, I came in with a bad smell. \"It's not good, what DLH said earlier, according to the mechanism, it's like that,\" explained Sangkala Saddiko.\nThe PT KIMA representative who was present at the RDP explained that PT. KIMA has a number of companies under it and is bound by an agreement.\nWhen starting an agreement with the tenant, there is an attachment to the waste water quality standards required by the tenant.\n\"We have that,\" answered the PT KIMA representative in the RDP.\n\"Then related to how it is managed, from us it is 24 hour operational when it comes to temperature, PH, CO and DO every week, so we analyze all the required parameters according to the company every week a month,\" explained the PT KIMA representative.\nHe also explained that since 2022, PT KIMA has been required by the Ministry of the Environment to provide tools called sparing and sparing tools. And this tool has been installed at PT KIMA's waste water outlet to monitor the environment directly.\n\"That is an obligation that we have carried out,\" said the PT KIMA representative.\nRegarding environmental performance, he admitted that he had held PROPER since 2004. Where PT KIMA achieved blue PROPER. These are the environmental performances that the party will probably carry out at this time.\n\"Then regarding why the waste water that reaches the Tallo River tributary is black, actually if you look at our environmental documents, our documents were actually written from the start. \"Our responsibility extends to the water bodies before the Tallo River tributaries,\" explained the PT KIMA representative.\n\"However, looking at the current fact that along the canal created by KIMA, the community and all entrepreneurs outside KIMA have connected it, so in 2018 at the Ministry of the Environment we revised the document, the ministry issued that it could no longer be charged by PT KIMA related responsibility along the canal,\" continued the PT KIMA representative.\n\"Why, because along the canal there are many connections from terminals, from markets and all MSME businesses, entrepreneurs and all kinds of things are all there. \"So the responsibility for environmental control is transferred to us, so we can only reach the beach point at the Sector Police,\" added the PT KIMA representative.\nHe admitted that the problem now is because everything is connected. In the past, he continued, when the wall was still intact and then it was broken into by the Head of the Daya Village, he also asked a Makasaar City Government official who at that time was known as Manai Sofyan.\n\"I asked why the wall was broken into, it would be polluted by the community, he said where else would the community's water go if it didn't come this way. \"So that's the reason, I still remember that time I went down to the field and we saw that our channels were already connected,\" emphasized the PT KIMA representative.\nTallo River Tributary Pollution Complaint\nThe Makassar City Environmental Service (DLH) discovered several facts about alleged environmental pollution that occurred in the Parangloe River, a tributary of the Tallo River, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District.\nFirst, there was foam in the Parangloe River, then there were dead fish and shrimp in residents' ponds which were approximately 50 meters from the river location in question.\nThe facts found in the field were based on documentary evidence in the form of videos and photos reported by a resident of Bontoa village, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District regarding the presence of foam on the surface of water bodies that spread across the Parangloe River.\n\"Now after discovering this fact, the team carried out a cross-check in the field with the aim of identifying and collecting data as material for further analysis,\" said Acting Head of DLH Makassar City, Ferdi, Monday 15 May 2023.\nThen Ferdi revealed that reports of water pollution in the Parangloe River, which he admitted was thought to be the result of industrial activities, had been discovered the previous year by the monitoring team.\n\"So this data and verification will be a complement or support for follow-up material,\" he explained.\nThen there are several companies that operate from downstream points to the West Ring Road along the Parangloe River, namely PT. KTC, PT MT, PT BFM, PT FKS MA.tbk, PT CPI (RPHU).\n\"There are still several other companies that have not been identified,\" he explained.\nHowever, based on the results of interviews with people around the location, information was obtained that there were five residential drainage channels that flowed down to the Parangloe River.\n\"This has not been identified because the weather at that time was rainy,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the location of the drainage channel for the residents of Bontoa Village is the Komunai Waste Water Disposal Installation (IPAL) which was built by the Makassar City Public Works Department in 2019.\n\"According to the local RW, the IPAL is no longer used because there is a blockage in the channel so that residents' septic tank waste water automatically flows into the drainage and then into the river,\" he said.\nNot only that, some of the houses of Bontoa Village residents cross the banks of the Parangloe River, so it is estimated that domestic wastewater is directly discharged into the river.\n\"There is a narrowing of the width of the Parangloe river at coordinates 5° 5'47.93″S\n119°28'21.60\"E so that the river water does not flow smoothly and there is a buildup of sediment which causes a smell and black water,\" he explained.\nHowever, based on the results of field parameter tests, it was revealed that the Parangloe River is a tributary of the Tallo River which is located in two sub-districts, namely Tamalanrea and Biringkanaya.\nThe activities along the Parangloe River are residential, industrial and pond activities. So these activities affect the carrying capacity and water quality of the Parangloe River.\nIt could even be fatal if the population increases and industrial activities along the Parangloe River affect the environmental conditions of the Parangloe River.\n\"Domestic wastewater discharge originating from residential areas and industry that is not managed properly will cause sedimentation and river water quality. \"This can be seen physically in the condition of the Parangloe River water,\" he explained.\nApart from residents' domestic wastewater, industrial and pond activities also contribute to the water quality of the Parangloe River. Moreover, industries that do not treat their wastewater properly will cause public unrest.\nFerdi explained that the appearance of floating or foamy foam could also be concluded from natural factors, namely the natural cycle of rain falling from the sky or the discharge of waste water all at once.\n\"To find out this, integrated monitoring is carried out involving environmental monitoring functions,\" he added.

It has been pitched as an industrial park, one which would, according to the company’s job postings, “be the first vertical, from mine mouth to finished products, integrated Electric Vehicle battery and stainless steel Industry complex in the world.”[1][2]\"\n\nEnvironmental Justice Atlas: \"Project details\nThe Indonesia Weda Bay Industrial Park (IWIP) is a mega-nickel integrated mining and smelter project [1] and also the “first vertical, from mine mouth to finished products, integrated Electric Vehicle battery and stainless steel industry complex in the world”[2], [3]. It is located in Weda, Central Halmahera Regency, North Maluku, Indonesia [3]. It is a joint venture with 11 billion investment between three Chinese companies, namely Tsingshan Group (40% shareholding through its subsidiary Perlux Technology), Huayou Group (30%) and Zhenshi Group (30%) [4]. The IWIP project requires a land area of 1,000 hectares and will provide space for tenants of ferronickel smelters, ferrochrome smelters, stainless steel plant, coke plant, carbon steel plant, and hydrometallurgical plant [5]. According to the information published by Global Energy Monitor, the total coal-fired power capacity operating or under development at Weda Bay is 3,400 MW (6 x 250 MW + 5 x 380 MW), while the lack of transparency makes it difficult to estimate the exact capacity of CFPP in operation and under development at IWIP [1], [6].\nA number of local and international nickel mining companies operate in the IWIP, including PT Weda Bay Nickel (WBN), PT Yashi Indonesia Investment, PT Libai Indonesia Metal Co, PT Weda Bay Energi, PT Youshan Nickel Indonesia. PT Weda Bay Nickel (WBN) is owned by Indonesian state-owned company PT Antam Tbk (10%) and Strand Minerals, whose shareholders are Chinese company Tsingshan (57%) and Eramet (43%) [7]. PT WBN was created in 1998 after the Contract of Work had been signed by the Indonesian government and a feasibility study was launched [7]. Previously the shareholders of WBN included Eramet (66.6%), Mitsubishi Corporation (30%) and Pamco (3.4%) [5]. However, the project was on hold for years due to the financial crisis and changes of ownership, until the partnership was forged between Eramet and Tsingshan. According to Eramet website information, 14.6 wet megatons of nickel ore and 39 kt of low grade nickel ferroalloy was produced at WBN in 2021 [19].\"", "Status (Operational, Operational with Continued Construction, Under Construction, Before Construction, Unclear, Stalled)": "Operational with Continued Construction", "Year Operations Began": 2022.0, "Year Construction Began": 2018.0, "Year Founded": null, "Age": 5.0, "Dispute": "Dispute with local residents", "Dispute Explanation": "Numerous protests from local residents, organizations and students over environmental damange, treatment of indigenous communities, and land acquisition\n\nMongabay.co.id, 3/8/23: Stories of Tobelo Indigenous Women Fighting When Damaged Forest Turns into a Mine\n\"\"-The Tobelo Dalam indigenous women and those living in coastal villages protested the destruction of the customary forest to make way for a nickel mine and various supporting facilities. Like last October, indigenous people, including women, blocked heavy equipment operations.\n-Novenia Ambeua,  an indigenous woman of Tobelo descent on the South Wasile coast , said that for the Tobelo people, the forest is home and sacred . If the forest is damaged, everything in it will also be damaged. Forests provide everything, from food such as hunting, medicine to sources of livelihood, including looking for resin.  Indigenous people's gardens are also in the forest.\n-The community rejects PT IWIP's expansion into Akejira Mein's  ( Aruku Ma Ngairi ) Indigenous Forest . They also demanded that the company stop paying compensation or compassion to other parties suspected of acting on behalf of the land owner.  \n-Achmad Zakih , Secretary of the North Maluku Forestry Service, dismissed the threat of forests in Central Halmahera. However, he said that it is necessary to strengthen the existence of indigenous peoples who have lived and lived in the forest for generations through a stipulation through regional regulations.\"\"\n\nEnvironmental Justice Atlas: \"\"The IWIP and the associated nickel mining and processing activities have significant impacts on the environment, biodiversity, and the indigenous communities in the area [8]–[10]. Back in 2010, Indonesian community and advocacy groups JATAM (Mining Advocacy Network), WALHI, KIARA, and KAU formed an international coalition to oppose the project and the World Bank’s support of WBN [11]. The groups filed a complaint with the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) of the World Bank [11]. Earlier studies indicated that there were significant barriers to access meaningful redress for communities that are remote in the area [2].\nOver the years, the Indonesian government has been trying to resettle the indigenous group in the region outside the forest and force them to adopt conventional settled lifestyles instead of their traditional nomadic lifestyle. These people, called the O Hongana Manyawa (also referred to as Tobelo Dalam, which allegedly was against the wishes of the people themselves [11]) and means “forest people” in their indigenous language. They are one of the five last remaining nomadic Indigenous Peoples in Indonesia and categorized as endangered [3], [12] according to Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara (Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago, AMAN), the main representative organization for Indonesia’s indigenous peoples. According to an interview with Tupa, one of the members of the six remaining tribes that are still practicing the traditional nomadic lifestyle in the forest, “Trees are gone and replaced with the big road, where giant machines go in and out making noise and driving the animals away” [3]. For the few last remaining tribe members in the forest, the forest is not only a place to inhabitat and find sources of food, it is “also a home and ‘the bridge’ that connects them with the spiritual world” [3]. It was also reported that a local resident of Lelilef Sawai Village indicated that she and other mothers were prohibited from fishing in Tanjung Uli, Karkar, and Cacu and from taking firewood [9]. The reclamation of nickel ore storage areas by PT IWIP in the Karkar area also affected local fishing activities that used to take place in the same area [9].\nAccording to the fieldwork and report of Indonesian NGO AEER, the villagers of Lelilef Sawai, Lelilef Waibulan, and Gemaf complained about respiratory problems due to air pollution from the captive coal-fired power plants that use low calorie coal with a calorie content of only 4,200 kcal/kg [9]. Local residents also had restricted access to clean water, with the 3km Ake Sake River dammed and diverted for the construction of one of the IWIP smelters and other rivers such as Seslewe Sini and Kobe polluted [9]. AEER indicated that the increase of logging and the damming and diversion of the Ake Sake River has led to deforestation and reduced water absorption capacity and contributed to the flood that took place in August 2020 which inundated the villages and roads, including the IWIP area [9].\nDuring the inaugural ceremony of the IWIP project in 2018, IWIP claimed that they had obtained community consent and that Akejira nomads, which Tupa belongs to, had agreed to the nickel mining activity in Central Halmahera [3]. This was questioned by Munadi Kilkoda, the regional chief of AMAN Malut (North Maluku) [13]. Some local residents had no other choice but to sell land to the company and the bid price from the companies was  low (e.g. IDR 8,000-9,000 per sq metre, equal to around half a euro) based on regional regulations [9]. While the majority of residents have sold their land, a few have refused to do so. It was reported that “intimidation by security forces, and dispossession of access to forest and other social and environmental concerns have sparked protest and denunciations of the projects” [11]. Some protests took place in 2019 by the relatives of O Hongana Manyawa band that live in Akejira forest [3]. Another protest took place in July 2020, when 450 South Wasile residents walked for two days to Kao Rahai, where PT WBN was opening a new nickel mining area, and blockaded roads by building tents and halting mining activities [9].\nIn addition, there were protests from students and civil society organizations in Ternate. AMAN urged IWIP to 1) comply with international laws and treaties including ILO Convention 169 and the UN Declaration on the rights of the indigenous peoples; 2) implement free, prior, informed consent (FPIC) on all forms of policies before operations that affect the livelihood of indigenous peoples; and 3) comply with Indonesian law, especially the Constitutional Court Decision Number 35/PUU-X/2012 regarding customary forests (not state forests) [3]. Students protested in Ternate and in Tobelo, North Halmahera, including the Student Action Solidarity for the Indonesian People (Samurai) Malut and the Sylfa Student Association of Kharun University [5], [14], [15]. The latter held a protest with the theme “Save Ake Jira, the Heart of Halmahera and the Tobelo Dalam Tribe”. The students demanded that the Halteng Regency Government ratify a local regulation on indigenous peoples in order to protect this tribe [5],[3]. IWIP representative responded [16] that they had obtained a borrow-to-use forest area permit (IPPKH) and that the Tobelo Dalam community is one of the main stakeholders in their mining concession, with whom they had developed a good relationship [5]. On the other hand, the issue of Ake Jira’s customary forest reached the Presidential Secretariat Office (KSP) in Jakarta with a letter sent by AMAN Malut that complained about the issues faced by the indigenous people of Tobelo Dalam in Central Halmahera after the arrival of WBN and IWIP in the area [16]. KSP issued a letter that urged the companies to respect and protect the indigenous people of Tobelo Dalam and align with the recommendations put forward by AMAN [16].\nOn 23 October 2019, another demonstration was held by Aliansi Masyarakat Ake Jira Halmahera (the Ake Jira Halmahera Community Alliance, AMARAH) in front of the Ternate Mayor’s office [17]. The crowd carried banners reading \"\" Selamatkan Ake Jira” (“Save Ake Jira”) and asked for the revocation of the Mining Business Permit (IUP) of IWIP, WBN and PT Tekindo Energy [17]. The AMARAH alliance is a coalition of NGOs, civic organizations, movements, and student associations, including Walhi Malut, AMAN Malut, LBH Marimoi, Daurmala, FNKSD, Sekolah Critis, GeMPAR, SAMURAI, LMND, GAMHAS, The Buas, PANDECTA, KAMMI IAIN, Jendela Mahasiswa Politik, Pusmat, Gemah IAIN, Jejak Timur, SEMUT, DEMA Ekonomi IAIN, and Gerilya Institut [17]. A representative of the demonstrators indicated that the mining activities in the Ake Jira forest not only threatens the Tobelo Dalam, but also has an impact on the waterbody in the region [17]. It was also indicated that the residents of Tobelo Dalam that lived in Ake Jira had left their original residential area due to massive mining activities, while AMARAH representative did not know where they had left for at the moment [14], [17].\"\"\"", "Legal dispute with Indonesian government": "0", "Legal dispute with a company": "0", "Dispute with local residents": "1", "Worker's rights dispute": "0", "Environmental Concerns": 1.0, "Environmental Concerns Explanation": "Environmental Justice Atlas: \"According to the fieldwork and report of Indonesian NGO AEER, the villagers of Lelilef Sawai, Lelilef Waibulan, and Gemaf complained about respiratory problems due to air pollution from the captive coal-fired power plants that use low calorie coal with a calorie content of only 4,200 kcal/kg [9].

Heri emphasized that he did not agree if it was said that the management of KIT was running in place or was just making a fuss. His party continues to work every day and communicate intensively with potential investors. \"With the current conditions they (investors, red) still don't want to invest in this area, so what else can we do,\" he said. Heri explained, in this KIT there are still problems that have not been resolved until now. Land legality, this is a big question from all incoming investors. Because until now, his party is still waiting for the HPL of the land. And the most important thing right now, Heri determined, what needs to be done is to prepare basic regional infrastructure, such as clean water supply, WWTP, environmental roads and so on. \"To prepare this requires a fairly large budget of around IDR 1.8 trillion,\" he explained.

The three elements each have shares of 75 percent, 20 percent and 4 percent.\nAccording to Watoni, the reason why the management of PT Kail has not held a GMS is because they have not received a recommendation from the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN). \"But when the DPRD came to the Ministry of BUMN to confirm this, one of the director generals (Director General) at the ministry said it was not necessary.

Delma Mining is one of 12 Coal Mining Work Agreements (PKP2B) which are currently still in the construction stage and not yet in production. Since the PKP2B was signed on November 20, 1997, it means that it took almost 15 years for Delma to carry out production. The process towards production, continued Bob, took a lot of time starting from the exploration period for the first 5 years to delaying production considering that the company's coal products are low in calories, namely 2,800 KKal/Kg (GAR) \"In the past, our total land area was 100,000 hectares, now it is only 20,160 hectares after the exploration process and so on. After [the coal] is known to have low calories, it cannot be marketed yet,\" he said...In addition, in the company's long-term plan, apart from increasing Delma's production, it also plans to increase the added value of coal, such as gasifying coal and building a mine-mouth PLTU. the plan is 2013 and the capacity is not large.

The land area of ​​this national strategic project reaches 3,151 hectares.\"To support the company's activities, an export port and a 101 hectare wind power plant will be built in the Pa'jukukang waters,\" said Ardi.vPT Huadi is the first smelter factory to be inaugurated in Bantaeng in January 2019 at KIBA. According to the local community, the company is said to have exported 15 times, starting from November 2018.vThere are three companies operating at KIBA. Namely, PT Huadi, Yatai and Wozhou. The company's operations are right next to the settlements of coastal residents in Papanloe Village. The seven hamlets in the village are directly affected by the activities of companies that produce materials for nickel raw materials.vThe coastal area of ​​Pa'jukukang is said to be designated as KIBA because it is considered dry and the land is unproductive. Even though most of the people there work as fishermen, seaweed farmers, the red stone manufacturing industry, and there are also rice fields. \"Especially in Papanloe Village, there are still 160 seaweed farmers, 114 of whom depend on the seaweed business,\" Ardi explained his data.\n2. The company's activities destroy the source of income for residents\nArdi said the activity of material transport ships disrupted farmers' seaweed cultivation. Seaweed locations that meet directly with ports and ship lanes are often damaged by being hit by ships. As a result, the location of the stretch of seaweed is damaged and unable to continue cultivation. Not only disrupting seaweed cultivation, the activities of material transport vessels also disrupt fishermen's fishing grounds. Of the seven hamlets in Papanloe Village, Mawang Hamlet is the hamlet that feels the most impact from the company's activities. The common impact that occurs is pollution. \"Such as smell, dust and noise,\" said Ardi. Dust, sourced from several company activities. Such as dust from material transport vehicles that use village roads as well as public access roads used by residents. Another source of dust, comes from drying the ore to the burning process through the furnace. The combustion process is also a source of dust as well as emits a pungent odor. \"To describe the smell, residents call it the smell of scorched canvas. The noise for 24 hours comes from heavy equipment activity in the company area, material transport car activities, and sounds in the form of bangs,\" said Ardi. Not to mention the problem of drought. In September 2021, the residents' wells in the Balla Tinggia hamlet, Kayu Loe and Mawang hamlet, Papanloe Village dried up. The drought is thought to have been caused by the drilled wells built in the three companies' areas. As a result of the identification, there were 18 residents' wells that had dried up. Even though the well is used for the daily needs of local residents. \"Before it dries up, the residents use the well for bathing and washing, as well as meeting the water needs for making or for the production of red stone,\" said the resident of Papanloe Village.\n3.

The goal is that the people living around KIBA can improve their standard of living. But in practice, the company is considered to be in denial. Instead, they recruit more workers from outside. \"The company has not prioritized Papanloe residents in recruiting employees. Of the total number of employees as of October 2021, there were 1,255 people, while there were only 220 employees from Papanloe Village,\" said Ardi.

This analysis process is carried out with the help of an application called Greenwich. From the results of this analysis, almost all areas in Bantaeng have sufficient wind energy potential to build a PLTB. However, the picture from the Greenwich application must be strengthened by the construction of a wind measuring tower as a condition for applying for a permit at PT PLN. \"We have determined the location of this wind measuring tower. The point is in Bantaeng District,\" he explained. He said, in the near future, Envision will sign a collaboration with the Bantaeng Regency Government to start this project.

Residents hope the project may bring jobs, but worry they will lose their traditional livelihoods as fishermen, farmers and increasingly, eco-tourism hosts as dust and ash smother their fields. An analysis by CELIOS of PT KIPI’s environmental impact assessment forecasts the the problems will worsen once the project begins operating.\n“The effects of hot water waste contamination, coal-fired power plant fly ash, rising air temperatures, project smoke, noise, sea dredging, and spilt coal/fuel spills will cause the sea to become murky, which will cause tourism (industry) to decrease and the quality and quantity of (fish) catches to significantly decrease,” it said.\"\n\n", "Legal dispute with Indonesian government": "0", "Legal dispute with a company": "0", "Dispute with local residents": "1", "Worker's rights dispute": "0", "Environmental Concerns": 1.0, "Environmental Concerns Explanation": "Environmental groups in Indonesia and abroad have raised concerns and staged protests over the proposed building of new captive coal power plants for the industrial park. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 of KIPI’s development, Adaro plans to build approximately 1000 MW capacity of coal power plants in each phase, before the anticipated hydroelectric power plants are ready to operate. In February 2023, it was reported that Adaro was having trouble finding financing for the development of their coal power plants, as many international banks that Adaro had previously borrowed from had pledged to stop supporting new coal projects (ft.com, 2/6/2023). Environmental groups also called out Hyundai, who plans to use aluminum from the smelter for electric vehicle production, for violating its own carbon neutrality principles. At Adaro’s 2023 annual shareholders’ meeting in May, two of its own shareholders protested against the planned captive power plants (news.mongabay.com, 6/15/2023). Mongabay also reported that it is unlikely the captive coal plants will be shut down in 2030, once hydropower is available, as the master plan for KIPI designates a zone of the park that is permitted to use power from coal power plants (news.mongabay.com, 6/15/2023). In May 2023, Adaro had only secured funding from domestic Indonesian banks for the first phase of the coal power plant development (1,060 MW capacity) (adaro.com, 5/16/2023).\n\napnews.com, 9/14/2023: New Indonesian industrial park on Borneo, feted as ‘green,’ will be powered by coal, report says\n\"...The environmental impact assessment commissioned by PT Kalimantan Industrial Park Indonesia, which operates a large part of the current development, describes what is happening in the 15,000 hectare (32,100 acre) area, where plumes of dust mushroom into the sky along the Celebes Sea as heavy equipment fells trees and razes paddy fields.\nIt says the project’s coastal zone is a conservation and migration area for green turtles, hawksbill turtles and killer whales. Hawksbill turtles are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while green turtles are considered endangered.\nHis wooden boat rocking as excavators and construction trucks roar nearby, fisherman Erwin laments the constant ship traffic delivering supplies to the remote area.\n'We are looking for fish further and further away from the beach because there are lots of ships in the area driving fish away,' said Erwin, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. 'If (the industrial park) is built, I don’t know what the future holds but it’s clear that it will definitely have an impact (and) hurt my income.'\"\n\nnew.mongabay.com, 6/15/2023: Indonesian coal giant Adaro’s ‘sustainable’ smelter slammed as ‘greenwashing’\n\"Indonesia’s largest coal miner, PT Adaro Energy, faces claims of greenwashing over its plan to build coal-fired power plants on the island of Borneo to provide electricity for its aluminum smelter there.\nAt its annual shareholders’ meeting in Jakarta on May 11, two shareholders protested against the planned captive power plants, known as such because they’re designed specifically to supply certain industries and not to feed into the grid.\n“Stop the development of new coal plants. One billion people will be threatened by the climate crisis due to coal plants,” one of the shareholders shouted while being escorted out of the meeting.\nThe plants, with a combined capacity of 2.2 gigawatts, will supply Adaro’s aluminum smelter in an industrial park, itself branded as “green,” in North Kalimantan province. The park is being touted, once completed, as the largest of its kind in the world, home to Indonesia’s first electric vehicle battery production, alongside petrochemical and aluminum industries.\nThe smelter project, estimated to cost $2 billion, has entered the preconstruction phase and is expected to start commercial operation in 2025. Once running at full capacity in 2029, it will be able to produce 1.5 million metric tons of aluminum a year, the company says.\nAluminum is used in the lithium nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide (NCA) cathodes that are the most widely cathodes currently found in EV batteries. Because of this, and the adjacent EV battery plant in the industrial park, Adaro is marketing the aluminum smelter project as a flagship green and renewable development for Indonesia.\n“Seeing the future development of electric vehicle (EV), the Company is ready to participate in providing aluminium for the EV’s material and support green economy for sustainable living,” Adaro said in a filing to the Jakarta stock exchange.\nBut building the smelter will start with building the coal-fired power plants to run them. Only later, in 2030, will the smelter switch to using power from a hydroelectric plant.\nAdaro said that while the main power source for the industrial park will be renewables, coal will still be needed in the initial stages of the smelter as it takes longer to build renewable power plants.\nBinbin Mariana, Southeast Asia energy finance campaigner at climate group Market Forces, noted that state-owned aluminum producer PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum) is also building a smelter in North Sumatra province — powered by two hydro plants.\n“By using hydropower plants, the cost of the aluminium production is much cheaper compared to using coal-fired power plants,” she said. “The cost if using hydropower is less than 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour, compared to 6 to 8 U.S. cents if using coal.”\nAnd even after Adaro makes the switch in 2030, it’s not clear whether the captive coal plants will be decommissioned, according to the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS), a Jakarta-based research institute.\n“Is there any guarantee that when the hydropower plant is ready, the captive coal plants will be shut down? No,” CELIOS executive director Bhima Yudhistira said.\nHe added that’s because the master plan for the “green” industrial park explicitly allows coal power: the estate’s environmental impact assessment maps out two zones, green and blue, with factories and smelters in the blue zone permitted to use power from coal plants.\nEven using the best available technology to minimize emissions, the captive plants will still emit an estimated 5.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gases per year, according to Market Forces.\nGreenpeace Indonesia energy campaigner Bondan Andriyanu said this goes against the Indonesian government’s pledge to phase out coal and switch to renewables in a bid to mitigate climate change. The planned coal plants will also dash any hope of meeting the wider goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5° Celsius (2.7° Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.\nThe International Energy Agency says there can be no new coal-fired power plants after 2021 if the world is to stay within this threshold, agreed on by nations including Indonesia in the Paris climate pact to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.\n“The development of a new coal plant will only exacerbate the impact of the climate crisis, pollute the environment, harm the people and Indonesia’s commitment in reducing carbon emissions from the energy sector,” Bondan said.\nLess money for coal\nNabilla Gunawan, Indonesia campaigner for Market Forces, called the smelter project “greenwashing” since it’s being marketed as sustainable. With other environmental groups also pointing this out, Adaro has reportedly struggled to raise money from international banks to finance the project.\nThe company had planned to get $1.1 billion in bank loans to help meet the $2 billion price tag, but several global banks that had previously done business with Adaro now say they won’t finance the smelter. This includes Singapore’s DBS and OCBC, and the U.K.’s Standard Chartered.\nFor coal companies like Adaro, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to get funding as a growing number of banks and investment funds announce their commitments to tackling climate change by no longer funding industries that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, according to Binbin of Market Forces.\nMany of these institutions are part of the U.N.’s Net-Zero Banking Alliance, accounting for about 40% of global banking assets. To date, 115 banks in 41 countries have joined the alliance.\nThat leaves a shrinking pool of banks willing to fund coal, especially for companies like Adaro, which not only plans to build new power plants, but also still has plans to prospect for new coal reserves, Binbin said.\n“What’s funny is that if you look at Adaro’s annual report in 2021, it says that they’re still exploring new mines,” she said.\nAdaro’s coal production hit a record high in 2022, amounting to 62.8 million metric tons, a 19% increase from the 52.7 million tons it mined in 2021, casting further doubt on the company’s commitment to transition away from coal.\nAdaro Minerals, the subsidiary in charge of the smelter project, has denied that the company is struggling to get funding for the project.\n“The rumor is not true,” Adaro Minerals director Wito Krisnahadi said as quoted by CNBC Indonesia, adding that they’ve been able to secure financing from at least five banks.\nWito declined to name the banks.\nAdaro Energy’s head of corporate communications, Febriati Nadira, said separately that the company is in the process of finalizing the deal to finance the project.\nAdaro Minerals has also denied allegations of greenwashing. President director Christian Ariano Rachmat said the company remains committed to transitioning toward green energy, but will need time to build the hydropower plant to meet the aluminum smelter’s demand for electricity.\nChristian also said that three-quarters of aluminum smelters around the world still use coal, hence Adaro’s case wasn’t an outlier.\n“One day, we want to produce green aluminium, but it needs time to get there, at least until our hydro [plant] is finished,” he said.\nHyundai driving into controversy\nBesides Adaro, critics have also gone after South Korean automobile giant Hyundai, which signed an agreement in November 2022 to buy aluminum from Adaro for its EV production. Hyundai described the aluminum as “green and low-carbon” because it would be produced using hydroelectric power, and thus would “accelerate” the transition to sustainable energy and help the company meet its net-zero emissions goal by 2045.\nBut the agreement fails to mention that hydropower will only come into the mix at a later stage, with the smelter initially relying on burning coal. That makes any purchase of aluminum from Adaro’s smelters a violation of Hyundai’s Carbon Neutrality Principles, Binbin said.\nThose principles require Hyundai to cut not just its own emissions, but also those emissions associated with assets it doesn’t own — like the aluminum it plans to buy from Adaro. These are known as Scope 3 emissions, and in 2022 Hyundai reported 18.3 million metric tons of Scope 3 emissions from its supply chain, up from 17 million metric tons in 2021.\n“This means that this 18 million tons of emissions have to be reduced,” Binbin said. “But if Hyundai buys aluminium from Adaro, the emissions [from its supply chain] will increase. So this doesn’t make any sense.”\nUPDATE: On 12 May 2023, the deal to finance the smelter project reached financial closing. A group of five Indonesian domestic banks – Mandiri Bank, Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), Bank Central Asia (BCA), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), Permata Bank – provided a total of 2.5 trillion rupiah (US$166.8 million) and US$1.5 billion loans to Adaro’s smelter and coal power plant subsidiaries, Kalimantan Aluminium Industry (KAI), and Kaltara Power Indonesia (KPI).\"\n\nPetrominer.com, 3/14/2023: Signed MoU with Adaro, Questioned Hyundai's Climate Commitment\n\"A coalition of environmental organizations from Indonesia and South Korea has raised concerns over the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by Hyundai Motor Company and PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia Tbk. The reason is that, based on the MoU, Hyundai can buy a maximum of 100,000 tons of aluminum per year from Adaro. Meanwhile, Adaro plans to build a new 1.1 GW coal-fired power plant as an energy source to produce aluminum.\nResponding to this problem, 10 environmental organizations from Indonesia and Korea have sent an objection letter to Hyundai on January 24, 2023. They also expressed their concerns over the cooperation plan, but until now Hyundai has not responded.\n\"We have expressed our concerns and sent a letter to Hyundai in January, but until now Hyundai has not updated our letter,\" said Campaigner from Market Forces, Nabilla Gunawan, Monday (13/3).\nAccording to Nabilla, this partnership with Adaro is in direct conflict with Hyundai's climate commitments. The reason is that Hyundai failed to take into account the consequences of building a new coal-fired power plant on the climate and environment.\n\"Hyundai has reneged on its commitment to environmentally friendly vehicles by using aluminum produced using a new coal-fired power plant,\" he said.\nEven though Adaro labels this aluminum smelter project as an 'environmentally friendly' project, the initial phase of the smelter will use electricity from a new coal fired power plant. In fact, the average PLTU in the world operates for 46 years, meaning that it will be difficult for Hyundai to achieve the carbon neutral target in 2045 if Hyundai still relies on aluminum produced from Adaro's coal energy.\n\"Electric vehicle consumers are increasingly skeptical that the goal of the energy transition is still littered with the massive use of coal,\" said Bhima Yudhistira from the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS).\nOn the previous occasion, the National Coordinator of the Mining Advocacy Network (JATAM), Melky Nahar, said that Indonesia does not need new coal-fired power plants which clearly pollute and damage the environment. Companies like Adaro have a history of destroying people's lives and have contributed to environmental disasters such as floods and landslides in Kalimantan.”\n“We were very concerned about Hyundai signing a memorandum of understanding to purchase aluminum produced by Adaro, when it became clear that the production would be supported by a new coal-fired power plant. Hyundai should not support dirty aluminum production by Adaro and encourage low-carbon investment in Indonesia,\" said Melky.\nCurrently, Adaro's aluminum smelter is known to have a planned capacity of 1.5 million tons per year in 2029. Adaro plans to rely on coal-fired power plants in the early stages, then add capacity from hydropower in the final stage.\"", "Land Acquistion Issues": null, "Specific mention of renewable energy": "Hydropower infrastructure currently being constructed.

The hydropower plant has a planned 1,375 MW capacity, and construction is expected to take 6-7 years to complete, followed by the construction of water storage.  \nAdditionally, a separate hydroelectric project in North Kalimantan, called the Kayan Cascade Hydroelectric Power Plant, plans to ultimately supply around 9,000 MW to KIPI. PT Kayan Hydro Energy has undertaken pre-construction activities since at least 2019, and has had a principal permit for the project since 2011. In October 2022 announced a collaboration with the Japan Sumitomo corporation to accelerate development (asia.nikkei.com, 10/6/2022). Previously, Kayan Hydro Energy had signed an MOU with PowerChina in 2018, with PowerChina Huadong and Sinohydro participating in the design, engineering and construction (ft.com, 9/2/2022). PowerChina first began studying the hydropower potential of the Kayan River in 2008. In September 2022, the Financial Times reported that “… the work has been hit with delays including the region’s difficult terrain, poor basic infrastructure and bureaucratic hurdles. Suryali said it took 10 years to obtain dozens of permits after North Kalimantan split from East Kalimantan to become a new province in 2012. These include permits for forest land use, environmental impact analysis and construction of the dams” (ft.com, 9/7/2022). On May 16, 2023, Kayan Hydro Energy announced it was resuming development of the project, after delays due to a legal dispute over conflicting permits to develop the hydropower project (tanahair.net, 5/16/2023). Construction is expected to begin this year, and will consist of 5 dams along the Kayan river and five to six units of power plant turbines. The planned electricity capacity is:\nPhase 1: 900 MW\nPhase 2: 1,200 MW\nPhase 3: 1,800 MW\nPhase 4: 1,800 MW\nPhase 5: 3,300 MW\n(Total: 9000 MW)\nThe first phase’s targeted completion is 2026, and phases two through five are targeted for completed 2 to 3 years following the first phase.

Now the Malacca Strait is one of the most densely populated straits in the world which is included in the Top 10 Strategic Straits in the World. The Galang Batang Special Economic Zone (KEK Galang Batang) is now ready to compete. Its strategic location on Bintan Island, Riau Archipelago creates various business opportunities. This area has direct access to the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea. Galang Batang SEZ was established through Government Regulation no. 42 of 2017 and has been operating since December 2018.\nInvestment potential and value\nIndonesia's bauxite production can reach 40 million tons a year. The value of bauxite will increase by around 5–13 times if it is processed into aluminum. Galang Batang SEZ which has an area of ​​2,300 hectares is focused on processing bauxite into alumina or aluminum. The investment value of the bauxite processing industry is estimated to reach IDR 36.25 trillion in 2027. In addition, this industry will create jobs for 23,200 people. The Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Airlangga Hartanto, estimated that the investment value could increase to US$5.5 billion or around Rp77 trillion. Until the end of 2020, the Galang Batang SEZ was considered the largest investment realization, with a value of around IDR 11 trillion, and succeeded in absorbing a workforce of 3,500 people.\nCurrently, in the Galang Batang SEZ there is one smelter company with an investment value of more than IDR 13 trillion or the equivalent of US$ 910 million. Supported by experts from China, the smelter company has built a steam power plant (PLTU). The company buys bauxite from local areas, such as Bintan, Lingga and Karimun Islands in order to achieve the target of processing one million tons of bauxite into alumina and pursuing alumina exports to Malaysia in mid-2021. Until now, the company continues to increase its aluminum production capacity.\nApart from processing bauxite, the Galang Batang SEZ has the potential to become a textile industrial area. Minister Airlangga said that this was a unique approach in the Galang Batang SEZ. \"\"Men can work in steel factories, while women can work in textile factories,\"\" he said.\"", "Status (Operational, Operational with Continued Construction, Under Construction, Before Construction, Unclear, Stalled)": "Operational with Continued Construction", "Year Operations Began": 2018.0, "Year Construction Began": null, "Year Founded": 2017.0, "Age": 6.0, "Dispute": null, "Dispute Explanation": null, "Legal dispute with Indonesian government": null, "Legal dispute with a company": null, "Dispute with local residents": null, "Worker's rights dispute": null, "Environmental Concerns": 1.0, "Environmental Concerns Explanation": "3/8/2023: DLHK and ESDM Riau Islands Call PT BAI's Cut and Fill in Galang Batang Not Violating the Rules\n\"The cut and fill activity carried out by PT Bintan Alumina Indonesia (BAI) on one of the hills in Galang Batang, Gunung Kijang District, Bintan Regency, had become a public concern.\nMoreover, cut and fill activities which are considered by many parties to have an impact on environmental damage, continue to be of public concern, especially environmentalists.\nHowever, regarding the cut and fill carried out by PT BAI, the Head of Forestry Management and Forest Product Utilization of the Riau Islands DLHK, Bherly Andia, said that the area being cut and filled was no longer a limited production forest (HPT) area, but already APL.\n\"PT BAI's cut and fill land on the Galang Batang hill is already an APL bleaching area (another use area).

Pupuk Kalimantan Timur as PSN in Fakfak (concerns related to development project potentially related to KI Teluk Bintuni)\n\"West Papua Senator Dr. Filep Wamafma responded to the designation of the development project of PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur (Pupuk Kaltim) in Fakfak Regency, West Papua as a National Strategic Project (PSN) by the Coordinating Ministry for the Economy (Kemenko for the Economy).\nSenator Filep admitted that he was surprised by this designation because the name PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur had never been mentioned as West Papua PSN in a Presidential Regulation (Perpres) including in its several amendments. However, the Project Development Kick Off Ceremony was carried out by the Board of Directors together with the Board of Commissioners of Pupuk Kaltim, Tuesday, 10 January 2023.\n\"As far as I can see, there is no mention of PT. Pupuk Kalimantan Timur as the PSN of the Fertilizer Industrial Area in Fakfak Regency, West Papua in the Presidential Decree, including in its several amendments. We are worried that this will become a serious problem considering the socio-political experience of the people in West Papua in general, who often intersect with the government, especially when it relates to indigenous peoples' land use,\" said Filep, Monday (16/1/2023)....\nIn this regard, the Deputy Chairman of Committee I DPD RI reminded about the experience of the 7 ethnic communities in Teluk Bintuni Regency regarding BP Tangguh. According to him, the settlement of compensation payments must go through a long procedure, debates, demonstrations, and other matters to obtain rights for indigenous peoples.\n\"Within that scope, strengthening the position of indigenous peoples in the new Papua Special Autonomy Law must also be considered. Its existence must continue to be recognized, maintained, maintained, and developed. That is why 10 percent of the Oil and Gas Revenue Sharing Fund (DBH) is allocated for empowering indigenous peoples,\" said Filep.\nFurthermore, Filep said, with regard to land use for PSN, Government Regulation Number 42 of 2021 concerning Facilitation of National Strategic Projects requires the Minister to coordinate the formulation of policy strategies and approval for handling social impacts submitted by ministers/heads of institutions, governors and regents. /mayor. This means that the government is required to have a policy to deal with social impacts, for example the rejection of indigenous peoples, refusal of compensation, including the environmental impacts caused.\n“The question is, has the regional government proposed the form or type of social impact to be analyzed by the central government? Traumatic experiences of indigenous peoples in West Papua related to development have often been experienced. Don't let this backfire on the government because the PP emphasizes that the minister facilitates problem solving in business licensing and land acquisition for National Strategic Projects,\" he said.\n\"In this PP, Ministers, governors and/or regents/mayors must prepare programs and budgets for handling social impacts for directly affected communities, namely people who control state land or land owned by the Central Government, Regional Governments, BUMN, or regionally owned enterprises, communities with land rights, or communities experiencing direct and measurable losses. Thus, social impacts, for example land acquisition for PSN in West Papua, must be resolved in an integrated, effective and efficient manner, without leaving prolonged conflicts,\" Filep added.\nOn the same occasion, Senator Filep also highlighted the dissemination which he considered not sufficiently heard regarding the location of the Pupuk Kaltim project. He considered that the steps for hearing opinions, gathering aspirations, involving affected communities were not heard at all. In fact, all of these points are very important for the living space of the community and the continuation of West Papua's Special Autonomy.\"\n\ninanews.co.id, 6/28/2022: \"The Bintuni Bay Industrial Area Development Plan to be implemented in Onar Village, Sumuri District, Teluk Bentuni Regency is a national strategic project. Where, the Bintuni Bay Industrial Area is not a regional project of Bintuni Bay Regency or West Papua Province. In the industrial area development plan, the aim is to realize the development of the methanol industry and its derivatives, including the development of petrochemicals, on an area of ​​2,112 hectares. \"This is one of the national priority strategic projects as part of the Major Project which is expected to be operational in the third quarter of 2024,\" said Teluk Bintuni Regent Ir.

And as regulated in Presidential Decree 18 of 2020 concerning the 2020-2024 RPJMN. According to Petrus, the determination of the location for the Bintuni Bay Industrial Area was carried out based on the results of an integrated survey initiated and carried out by the Ministry of Industry, Bappenas, Sucofindo and including PT. Indonesian fertilizer. Petrus continued, everything has been fully contained in the Feasibility Study Document (FS) which has considered various aspects, including aspects and analysis related to facilities and infrastructure. \"Various industrial supports including port development, as well as financial feasibility analysis, including the concept of industrial area planning, the survey involved various experts in their fields,\" said the Regent. As for the status of the land itself, Petrus explained that the Bintuni Bay Industrial Area at 2,112 hectares has status as an Area for Other Purposes (APL) that is no longer in contact with forest areas. \"This industrial area is a Major Project (Top Priority) which is expected to operate in the third quarter of 2024, so that in Presidential Regulation number 109 of 2020 concerning the third amendment to Presidential Decree number 3 of 2016 concerning the Acceleration of Implementation of National Strategic Projects which is expressly stipulated in the list of projects national strategy in attachment point 1,\" explained Petrus. The Regent also explained the reasons for the need for an Industrial Area in Teluk Bintuni Regency, because Bintuni Bay has natural oil and gas resources which are currently being exploited and produced by BP. Berau Ltd and Genting Oil Kasuri Pte, Ltd. It will produce gas from the Asap, Kido Merah wells in Sumuri, and is expressly contained in the Genting Oil Kasuari Genting Oil Kasuari first AMDAL document. That gas production from the ASAP, KIDO and MERAH wells will all be allocated to the Onar Sumuri Industrial Area, Teluk Bintuni. Through the Directorate General of Oil and Gas, SKK Migas represented by Fatat Yani Abdurahman, Genting Oil Kasuri represented by Nara Nilandaru and PT.

The community submitted a report document containing traces of environmental and humanitarian crimes from NCKL company’s operations in Kawasi, Obi Island, South Halmahera, North Maluku Province.\nThe Harita Group subsidiary is projected to gain an increase in net worth from USD 1.1 billion to USD 4.6 billion. This action was carried out to convey to brokers, as public intermediaries in buying and selling shares related to the dangers of investing in NCKL.\nPT Trimegah Bangun Persada Tbk (NCKL) is a subsidiary of Harita Group that operates the first High Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) smelter on Obi Island, North Maluku. The company produces 60,000 tons of nickel per year. HPAL technology will convert local low-grade ore into mixed hydroxide deposits, a form of nickel that can further be processed to make batteries.\nIn its operations, PT Trimegah Bagun Persada, along with PT Gane Sentosa Permai, PT Halmahera Persada Lygend, PT Megah Surya Pertiwi, and PT Halmahera Jaya Feronickel on Obi Island, all companies under the auspices of Harita Group, have devastated the land / plantation land of residents, polluted water sources, river water, and sea water, polluted the air due to dust and pollution that has an impact on the health of residents, to trigger social conflicts due to intimidation and repeated violence against residents who defend their living spaces. PT Trimegah Bangun Persada and  a number of other companies owned by Harita Group also unilaterally annexed residents’ land without fair negotiation and compensation.\n“Lili Mangundap and four other families who owned land in Kawasi village were annexed by the company. The company and the South Halmahera Regency government also plan to relocate Kawasi residents to Eco Village Housing, located 5 kilometers to the south of Kawasi. For residents, this relocation not only removes them from their homes, but also robs them of their cultural and historical values. Not only that, residents are also excluded from their sources of life such as land, fields, and the sea,” said Muhammad Jamil, Head of the Legal Division of JATAM Nasional.\nHarita Group’s mining operations resulted in polluted water sources of Kawasi residents and sedimentation of nickel ore from the company’s operations. Before the mine came in and operated, residents could get water for free, but now they have to spend money to get clean water. This condition makes it more difficult for residents who are economically deprived because they are forced to use polluted water sources. PT Trimegah Bangun Persada and other Harita Group-owned companies in the region dump waste into rivers and flow into the sea. This causes the coast and sea to turn cloudy-brownish. The marine ecosystem on Obi Island is damaged by sewage pipes leading to the sea. The fish that have been consumed by residents are also contaminated with heavy metals.\nIn addition to pollution in the sea, the company’s activities are so close to settlements, that residents are forced to deal with dust, noise, and a dirty environment. During the dry season, kitchen utensils, dining tables, chairs, floors, and even in the room are full of dust from company activities and coal dust. Based on information from residents and officials at Kawasi health clinic, acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most important health problem in Kawasi. Most patients are toddlers. There were 124 infants aged 0-1 years who visited the health clinic from January to December 2021. Toddlers aged 1-5 years were recorded as many as 283, followed by the age group of 20-44 years as many as 179 people.\nIn addition to bringing health problems, Harita Group’s operations also ignore the OHS Compliance aspect of its workers. Throughout 2022, the mining and mineral processing sector dominated accidents in North Maluku, especially belonging to Harita Group. Based on media reports, in the 2019-2023 time frames, 8 cases were recorded with 2 victims died and 5 people were injured. This fact refutes Harita Group’s claim that there were no casualties due to work accidents. In nickel mining operations, Harita Group, through PT Halmahera Persada Lygend (HPL), also uses coal-fired power plants for operations. The total capacity of the coal-fired power plant is 210 MW. PT HPL is a joint venture between Harita Group and Ningbo Lygend from China which has around 2,030 MW of coal-fired power plants in the process of construction and pre-permitting. The company also targets a total of 4,200 MW of coal-fired power plants on Obi Island. The construction of the power plant violates the commitment of Chinese President, Xi Jinping, through his speech in 2021, which stated that he would not build new power plants abroad.\n“With all the environmental and social damage made by Harita Group, the company has underwriters, namely Credit Suisse Group, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Mandiri Sekuritas, DBS, OCBS Securities, and UOB Kay Hian. six underwriters from Harita Group companies -except Mandiri Sekuritas, are members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. Their collaboration with Harita Group certainly undermines GFANZ’s commitment itself in supporting the achievement of zero emission targets and a just clean energy transition,” said Novita Indri, a campaigner from Trend Asia.\"\n\nindoprogress.com, 1/14/2023: Details unfair land compensation case of Lily Mangudap, environmental degradation and pollution of water sources, increased resident health problems, lack of access to electricity, forced relocation\n\nMongabay.co.id, 12/9/2022: Surrounded by Nickel Industry, Kawasi Residents Face Environmental Problems, Protest Village Relocation\n-  \"The community consisting of religious leaders, traditional leaders, village government and cross-organizations approached the South Halmahera DPRD, questioning the news about the Kawasi Village relocation plan after the nickel mining company, PT Harita Group, began operating on Obi Island.

The first phase of the project includes the construction and installation of the system. The target is that the CPP is claimed to supply energy sources for the development of nickel smelters as raw materials for the battery industry...This project also has a negative impact on the people living around the project area. Lily Mangundap, as in her interview in Project Multatuli, said that this nickel smelter industry project had slowly “killed” her and her family. The company PT Trimegah Bangun Persada, a subsidiary of the Indonesia Harita Group, forcibly evicted its plantation land to expand its concession by building a nickel smelter. The land that was Lily’s source of livelihood disappeared and turned into the Obi Island Industrial Estate, which produces nickel ore as the raw material for batteries for electric vehicles.\"\n\nmongabay.co.id, 11/14/2021: \" Obi Island, in South Halmahera, North Maluku, has built a nickel downstream industrial area and built a factory for the production of electric vehicle battery raw materials.

It’s been quiet on this island for most of his life. Without a private jet, getting to Obira from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, is at least a two-day journey involving an overnight ferry and hours of driving on roads stippled with potholes.\nLiyus, who goes by one name, said he used to drink from the rivers that run past his village, but since the nickel mine added its acid-leaching refinery two years ago, the waterways have turned dark red, so thick with pollution at some points that rows of coconut trees have been killed off. He doesn’t know what’s in the water, only that it bleeds into the sea and that his nephews have had to go farther and farther out to find fish. He pointed to a fishing net drying on a nearby tree. It was stained a reddish brown.\nIn an hour-long interview, representatives from the two companies that jointly own the processing plant on Obira island — an Indonesian firm, Harita Group, and a Chinese firm, Lygend Resources — said that the operation has not had a negative impact on the environment and that the pollution along the coast was not related to waste produced by their plant. All of their operations, they emphasized, are in “full compliance” with government requirements. “We looked at what was the best and we confirmed it with the government,” said Tonny Gultom, Harita’s head of health, safety and environment...\nThe nickel mine on Obira has been operated by Harita since 2016, but in 2018, Lygend joined to plan, design and construct the HPAL refinery, eventually acquiring a majority stake in the project. The processing facility, which was designated a priority for the national government, opened in 2021.\nAfter the companies withdrew their initial plan to dump the HPAL waste into the sea, they told authorities that they would store the waste on land, drying out the acidic slurry before dumping it back into the mining pit, and then treating the residue water in a tailings “pond.”\nOnly a year earlier, however, Harita executives had published a research article in a science journal stating that land disposal on Obira is actually “less suitable” because the region is in a notoriously active seismic zone — as recently as 2019, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake devastated a port town on Bacan island, less than 50 miles from Obira — and is frequently visited by heavy rainfall. That article also noted that about 7,000 villagers lived downstream from the site, concluding that the construction and water control required for land disposal was “not feasible.”\nAsked about those findings, a Harita spokesman acknowledged that storing the waste on land is dangerous but said the company is managing the risks by drying out the slurry and dumping it back into the mining pit, where it is prevented from seeping into local waterways.\nBut a foreign mining consultant who has been working on projects in Indonesia for more than two decades said: “It’s a massive heap of waste. And if it’s not stored properly, you can have landslides. That’s my biggest concern.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of business considerations...\nFour international mining experts independently reviewed photos of the mining site at Obira taken by The Washington Post. The experts said that it was impossible without a formal audit to ascertain whether Harita and Lygend were dumping HPAL tailings into the sea, but that there were multiple signs that the companies were generally failing to contain mining waste.\nThe photos show “devastating” levels of deforestation, which can increase the risks of tailings accidents, said Aimee Boulanger, executive director of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, an organization that audits mining operations and measures them against social and environmental standards. Even if tailings were not being actively pumped into the sea, there don’t appear to be “any significant controls” over what’s flowing out of the mine and entering waterways, she added.\nSam Riggall, an advocate of responsible mining and the chief executive of Sunrise Energy Metals, an Australian nickel and cobalt mining company, said the material entering the rivers around the mining facility resembled processed waste, rather than just runoff from open-pit mines...\nGultom, Harita’s head of safety, acknowledged that the HPAL refinery was producing a “huge volume” of waste that could pose safety risks if not properly managed, but he stressed that it was being handled with adequate precautions.\nThe discolored water near Obira’s coast, he said, was caused by sedimentation created by timber mining years ago. “It has nothing,” Gultom said, “to do with us.”\nHarita, which debuted on the Jakarta stock exchange in April, plans to add a second processing plant on Obira next year, company executives said.\"\n\nindoprogress.com, 1/14/2023: Details unfair land compensation case of Lily Mangudap, environmental degradation and pollution of water sources, increased resident health problems, lack of access to electricity, forced relocation\n\nMongabay.co.id, 12/9/2022: Surrounded by Nickel Industry, Kawasi Residents Face Environmental Problems, Protest Village Relocation\n-  \"The community consisting of religious leaders, traditional leaders, village government and cross-organizations approached the South Halmahera DPRD, questioning the news about the Kawasi Village relocation plan after the nickel mining company, PT Harita Group, began operating on Obi Island.

The state-owned mining company that has been reaping annual net profit of around Rp1.15 trillion, has also been dumping waste from its nickel mining operations high up on the hill, to the coast.\nThe waste released by the company that has been operating there since 2006, has now covered and polluted the bottom of the coastal area. Anas says that the place where he is now standing, was once teeming with corals, a habitat for fishes and other marine life.\nHis father, who was a fisherman from Sulawesi and moved to the area under the government’s sponsored transmigration program in the 1980s, often recounted that there used to be so many fishermen working in Moronopo Bay but now no more.\n“The mackerels which are commonly consumed by people were a staple.

It takes five hours to reach the area from Sofifi, the main town in North Maluku.\nThe East Halmahera Environment Agency has noted that the waste sedimentation had covered an area of four hectares. At the farthest point from the coastline, about 100 meters from the source of the waste disposal, the waste layer, consisting of mud and rock, rises up to almost one meter from the beach surface.\nThe company tried to cover the waste by planting mangroves but Anas said it was a failed attempt as the waste continued to flow into the bay and the mangrove could not survive, in contrast to the naturally grown mangroves in the area.\nIn one corner where mangrove seedlings had just been planted, a board that says “PT Antam Mangrove Planting Conservation” sticks out from the ground. The board also indicates the first mangrove was planted in 2009.\n“So, these mangroves were planted in hopes to reduce the impacts of the waste pollution and it has been done several times, but they are still a far cry from the massive scale of their mining activities,” Anas said.\nThe worsening condition of the Moronopo bay is what prompted local residents to hold a protest on April 7, 2021, demanding that Antam cease all its mining activities. There was no response from the company.\nThe nickel mining operation on top of the hill in the Moronopo Bay area, is part of a mining concession owned by Antam and will expire in 2040.

Mining activities in Routa are currently underway. PT.IKIP will explore over the mining business permit area (IUP) owned by PT.SCM, which is an area of ​​3,563 hectares. The corporation is currently building an industrial complex with various other supporting infrastructure. \nThe presence of investment in Routa is projected to absorb around six to eight thousand workers. It is believed that the absorption of so many workers will alleviate unemployment. Routa, which was previously branded as a marginal area, is now predicted to become a developed area thanks to the influx of investment in the region. \nKonawe Regent Kery Saiful Konggoasa said, through private investment in Routa, nickel factories and other derivatives will be built in that area. This includes nickel derivatives, namely lithium, which is used as a raw material for making electric vehicle batteries. \"We are grateful for the investment in Routa. We need the investment in order to accelerate regional progress. This investment will also help us overcome employment problems in Konawe,\" Regent Kery told Kendari Pos yesterday. \nMeanwhile, Konawe Secretary (Sekab) Konawe Ferdinand Sapan stated, PT.SCM has so far continued to improve the progress of the development of industrial estates in Routa. Including, the acceleration of the production process this year from the initial target in 2024. Ferdinand said, the Konawe Regency Government had also provided support as a form of support for accelerating the development of industrial estates in Routa by PT. SCM. \n\"The government's support, one of which is that we accelerate the Routa Detailed Spatial Plan (RDTR). Thus, when corporations build their industrial estates or other supporting areas related to industry, it will have a positive impact on the community. That's why, we have to prepare the RDTR from the start ,\" he explained. \nWith that support, said Ferdinand Sapan, PT.SCM will consistently prioritize all the potential that exists in Konawe to support the company's production activities. Whether it's the potential of natural resources (SDA) or human resources (HR). \nThe former Head of BPKAD Konawe admitted that on various occasions when he met delegations from PT. SCM, he always asked the corporation to prioritize local potential rather than looking elsewhere. \"One of the things I conveyed to the company, if they need to eat there and still eat from rice, never buy rice from other places. They have to buy rice from Konawe. Later, if Konawe can't afford it, then look elsewhere,\" said Ferdinand Sapa. He said, to further strengthen the commitment between the government and the private sector regarding investment in Routa, the Konawe Regency Government will also make a memorandum of understanding with PT.SCM. For example, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) related to the concept of managing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds which is the responsibility of the company. \n\"So we use methods like that. The MoU includes the education sector. Later we will try to convey that our human resources need to be pushed or increased in level. So that the company must take a role in it,\" explained Ferdy, the nickname of the Regency Secretary. Konawe it. \nFerdy continued, industrial activity in Routa by PT. SCM, would certainly open up new jobs in the local authorities. Many Konawe local workers (TKL) can be recruited by the company. Ferdinand Sapan said, the latest report from PT. SCM, 2,500 workers had been recruited to build the mega industrial complex in the westernmost region of Konawe. But the problem going forward, he continued, is when corporations need skilled workers (skills). Meanwhile, the readiness of Konawe's human resources with special skills is still relatively low. \"One of the things we have prepared is the later integration of the need for skilled workers from the Polytechnic in Morosi. And also, later we will build other vocations. We will also try to communicate with other universities. Both in Konawe as well as in the provincial capital,\" concluded Ferdy.

Various efforts will be made to achieve the investment realization target, including providing convenience in permitting investors to invest in NTB. Apart from that, we also provide guidance, supervision, and acceleration of realization for investors, especially national strategic projects, one example of which is the smelter,\" explained Rum.\nRegarding the contribution of the AMMAN smelter, President Director Rachmat Makkasau said that this achievement illustrates the company's commitment to supporting economic growth.\n\"This achievement is the result of a joint collaboration where we see enormous support for the construction of smelters, both from the central and regional governments. We really hope that support from the government will continue to be given to us so that the smelter project can continue to run in parallel with our operational business activities, so that other big projects that will increase investment value can be realized. Apart from supporting the NTB Province to achieve its 2023 investment target, this is also in line with the statement from the Coordinating Ministry for the Economy, Mr. Airlangga Hartarto, last Monday, which will continue to encourage the realization of the National Strategic Project (PSN) by resolving obstacles related to licensing for investment,\" said Rahmat.\nLooking at the results of last semester's verification, AMIN's smelter has reached 47 percent. This achievement is based on the calculation of the realization of the budget requirements for the smelter, which includes physical construction and also the purchase of equipment and machinery for operations.\nThe investment value that has been spent is equivalent to US$ 466 million out of a total of US$ 982 million. This shows the company's commitment to continuing the construction of the smelter. However, the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis in Europe, which are external factors, have caused logistical and human resource (HR) mobilization constraints, so that the target of completing the smelter in 2023 will not be realized.\nThe AMMAN smelter is targeted for completion in 2024. Some time ago, AMMAN also held a meeting with the NTB Government to explain the company's operational achievements and business plan in 2023.\nOn this occasion, the President Director of AMMAN said that the absorption of human resources (HR) for various projects since 2021 had increased to 35%, of which nearly 75% came from NTB.\nAMMAN is the second largest group of copper and gold mining and processing companies in Indonesia. The AMMAN Group includes PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (PT AMNT) which operates the Batu Hijau mine and PT Amman Mineral Industri (PT AMIN) which builds and operates a smelter facility...\"\n\nVoi.id, 11/7/2022: Construction Of Amman Mineral Smelter In West Sumbawa Is Almost Capai 50 Percent, Targeted By Rampung In 2024\n\"The metal mineral processing plant (smelter) construction project developed by PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (AMMAN), until early November 2022 almost reached 50 percent.\nThe amount of funds that have been disbursed has reached 465 million dollars out of the total investment requirement estimated at US $ 982 million or equivalent to Rp. 14.7 trillion.\nHead of Corporate Communications of PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara, Kartika Octaviana said the construction of the smelter was completed in 2024 from the initial projection set by the government in June 2023.\nKartika added, the construction of a smelter in Batu Hijau, West Sumbawa Regency, West Nusa Tenggara, should have been delayed a little from the schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis creates a number of face-to-face meetings to discuss the specifications of delayed smelter engineering and engineering which will have an impact on the construction work timeline, as well as delays in the negotiation process and financial statement decision.\n\"As a result, the mobilization of large equipment and equipment that is very important for the construction of smelters, especially from Europe, has been delayed from the initial schedule,\" Kartika said as quoted by Antara, Monday, November 7.\nThis year, Kartika continued, the challenges are even greater with the Ukraine-Russia conflict affecting the delay in supply chain, in the form of increasing cost of mobilizing goods and humans, lack of containers, to closing ports.\nConsidering that almost 50 percent of investment has been disbursed, Kartika continued, it is impossible for the mineral mining company, which is affiliated with PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk, to withdraw from the smelter project.\n\"This means that we remain committed to completing the construction of the smelter, especially since the funding is also available,\" he said.\nThe Green Stone smelter project is projected to have a production capacity of 222,000 tons of copper cathode. In addition, the smelter will produce 17.8 tons of gold, 54.7 tons of silver and 830.000 sulfate acid.\nAMMAN's Head of Social Impact Priyo Pramono added that the six-month verification achievement always exceeded the target and the construction of the camp was completed in October 2022.\n\"The smelter construction and supporting facilities have also started since July 2022 with the installation of stake poles, including the installation of special water facilities, in the form of desalized water and dem generalization. The mobilization of contractors to the construction area has also been carried out,\" he said.\nPriyo added that the purchase order for the long lead equipment has been executed. Moreover, there has been a signing of an agreement to finance syndicates from banks and companies that have processed recruitment in stages according to the construction stage, in collaboration with the West Sumbawa Regency Government (KSB) and NTB.\"\n\n8/11/2022: KSB \"All Out\" Helps Realize Smelter Development\n\"The Regional Government of West Sumbawa Regency (KSB) is making every effort to help create a smelter or metal mineral smelting industry which is currently in the process of preparing for development. Moreover, in accordance with President Jokowi's directives, that all regional leaders must support the acceleration of investment in their respective regions.\nKSB Regent Dr. HW Musyafirin said that the smelter in this area will later trigger a derivative industry that can move the economy even faster. So that in this preparation process, the KSB Regional Government together with the NTB Provincial Government and PT. Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (AMNT) actively communicates with the central government so that all processes run smoothly.\nHe said the location for the smelter construction was in Otak Keris Hamlet, Maluk District, KSB. Maluk District itself has been designated by the central government as a priority industrial area along with 26 other priority industrial areas in Indonesia.\n\"The Maluk District has been decided to become an industrial area out of 27 priority industrial areas to be built in Indonesia and it is included in the national medium-term development plan for 2020-2024,\" said HW Musyafirin in a special interview with Suara NTB recently.\nIn order to create an industrial area, including for the construction of a smelter, the Regional Government of KSB has the principle that there should be no obstacles, especially those that come from the government. The government must go all out to provide support.\n''So from the start we were with the Regional Leadership Communication Forum, where there were the Chair of the PN, the Chair of the DPRD, the Kajari, the Head of the Police and the Dandim all out to help,'' said the Regent.\nHe said, PT. AMNT has written a letter to KSB containing a request for facilitation of land acquisition in Otak Keris Hamlet, which incidentally is a village area. Initially the Regional Government of KSB hoped that the Smelter could be built in the coastal area, especially where PT. AMNT already owns around 200 hectares of land.\n''However, technically the location did not meet the requirements, so during the trip the Otak Keris area was chosen, even though this is a village area,'' he said.\nOtak Keris is included in the plan to establish an industrial area with an area of ​​1,164 hectares. Because it will be used as an industrial zone, land in hamlets with around 60 families is included in the land acquisition priority.\n''What was needed at that time was 150 hectares, plus another 20 hectares. So more or less what we have freed is around 170 hectares, and it's all clear . Until the last, around 61 hectares, the settlement was through the courts. It's already inrah, the decision from the Supreme Court has also been passed,''explained the Regent.\nMusyafirin admitted that he is very optimistic that this smelter will definitely be realized, especially since his party has moved very far to realize this project. It's just that the Covid-19 pandemic has hampered this program a bit, but in principle this smelter will still be built according to plan.\nCurrently, in preparation for the construction of a smelter, camps or workers' camps are being built with a total of around 2000 – 3000 camps. An engaged workforce with prioritizing local labour. Even now, the Integrated Team tasked with recruiting workers is currently selecting around 1,200 workers for smelter preparation.\n Regarding the proportion of local workers in the construction of this smelter, the Regional Government of KSB certainly prioritizes local workers and local resources for company needs. Likewise other resources such as building materials and food needs so that PT. AMNT absorbs the maximum from the local community.\n“In every meeting with AMNT, we always convey that local resources must be a priority. Local resources such as materials, sand, crushed stone, as well as local materials such as rice, vegetables and others. Including labor resources, it must be prioritized from KSB,\" he said.\nThe KSB Regent admitted that he had drafted a regional regulation so that it was the responsibility of the company, and all sub-contractors working in KSB to use local human resources of at least 40 percent. Prior to drafting this Perda, a Perbup first appeared which required companies to absorb local workers and other local resources with a minimum amount of 60 percent.\n“However, we will make a regional regulation for a minimum of 40 percent of resources. Moreover, the central government has asked that spending on local products be at least 40 percent in the regional budget. We try to comply with regulations,\" he explained.\nThe Regional Government of KSB has conducted a comparative study in Gresik, East Java to take a close look at the smelter industry there and its derivative industries. The Department of Manpower has been given orders to train local workers to become skilled by inviting the involvement of PT. AMNT.

It means that Indonesia will soon have three copper smelters – PT Smelting Gresik, which has been operating as the single in-country smelter since 1996, plus the new PTFI and AMMAN smelters now in-development.\nThe contracts were signed between AMIN and China Non-Ferrous Metal Industry’s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co Ltd (NFC) as well as PT Pengembangan Industri Logam (PT PIL) in a virtual ceremony on Friday, December 10, 2021. The signing ceremony was witnessed by the Governor of West Nusa Tenggara Province and the Regent of West Sumbawa Regency. AMIN’s President Director, Rachmat Makkasau signed both contracts at AMMAN’s headquarters in Jakarta. In his speech, Makkasau stated that these contracts reiterate AMMAN’s commitment to building the copper smelter & PMR projects according to government regulations.\n“I would like to thank all parties who have been very patient and persistent in bringing amicable closure on technical, commercial & financial fronts to produce these contracts, despite immense challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic. This contract will soon be followed up by the mobilisation of all contractors, project management companies, including workforce, equipment, and supplies. We have identified certain project challenges that we may encounter and prepared some mitigation plans. To execute this megaproject, we need support from all stakeholders, including the government at local and national levels, business partners, and the surrounding communities” he said.\nNFC will be the main contractor that supplies the materials and equipment for the 0.9 Mt/y copper smelter and PMR facilities. The technology and patented equipment for the project will be procured from prominent original equipment manufacturers around the globe by NFC, such as NERIN & Yanggu of China for the smelting & converting technologies, MECS of the USA for the gas cleaning and sulphuric acid plants, Kumera & Metso-Outotec of Finland for anode furnaces & casting wheels, while Glencore Technology of Australia has been entrusted with providing the design & technology for a copper electro refinery...\"\n\nBappeda.ntbprov.go.id, 7/2/2021: Coordination Meeting for the Preliminary Survey for the Development of Industrial Estates in West Sumbawa Regency\n\"Friday, July 2, 2021 at the Orchid Meeting Room of the Office of the Governor of West Nusa Tenggara Province, a Preliminary Survey Coordination Meeting was held for the Development of Industrial Areas in West Sumbawa Regency, West Nusa Tenggara Province by the NTB Province Financial and Development Supervisory Agency (BPKP). The meeting was opened by the Regional Secretary of the NTB Province (Mr. Drs. H. Lalu Gita Ariadi, M.Sc.) and was attended by Assistant II of the NTB Provincial Secretariat, the NTB Provincial BPKP Team, West Sumbawa Regency Secretary, and elements of the NTB Provincial Government (Head of the ESDM Service , Head of the Bappenda, Head of the Bureau of Procurement of Goods and Services, Head of the Economics Bureau, Head of the PUPR Office Spatial Planning, Head of the DPMPTSP Investment Sector, Representatives of the NTB Provincial Bappeda and several other invitees).\nOn this occasion, BPKP said that it had coordinated with all stakeholders in both NTB Province and West Sumbawa Regency regarding the Mining Industry Development Plan (SMELTER) and its derivative industries in West Sumbawa Regency in the framework of a preliminary survey of 13 aspects. From the results of the survey, 4 aspects were obtained which had sufficient evidence, namely; licensing/non-licensing aspects, project preparation aspects, spatial planning aspects and land provision aspects. While the other 9 aspects, namely funding, government guarantees, procurement of goods/services, project development implementation, prioritizing domestic components, supervision and control, project regulations, work creation aspects and aspects of utilization do not yet have strong evidence or supporting data.\nIt is hoped that the BPKP will be able to obtain updated information from the NTB Provincial Government, West Sumbawa Regency Government and PT. Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (PT. AMNT) so that BPKP can carry out a comprehensive and integrated cross-sector supervisory role in overseeing the Development of Industrial Estates in West Sumbawa Regency which can ultimately fulfill development accountability in achieving the RPJMN project targets, the NTB Provincial RPJMD and the President's priority programs.\nThe current issues of smelter development discussed include:\nThe issue of land acquisition, where in the 154 hectares of land for smelter construction there is still land that has not been acquired;\nChanges to the construction schedule and completion of the smelter construction which was originally planned to be completed in 2022 to 2023;\nChange in production capacity from 1.3 MTPA to 0.9 MTPA;\nThe progress of the smelter development has not been significant.\nIn response to this problem, the NTB Provincial BAPPEDA represented by the Young Expert Planning Functional (B. Sri Ratna Setiawati, ST, M.Eng.) said that the Industrial Area of ​​West Sumbawa Regency had been listed in the Revised RTRW of NTB Province as a Provincial Strategic Area from the point of view of growth interests economy. In addition, in the Spatial Pattern Plan, both the Revised RTRW for the Province of NTB and the Regional Regulation on the RTRW for West Sumbawa Regency, it is stated that the area of ​​the West Sumbawa Regency Industrial Area is 1,160 Ha, which is divided into several zones, as follows:\nThe smelter zone and its derivative industries cover an area of ​​850 Ha which has received recommendations for suitability for spatial use from the NTB Provincial Spatial Planning Coordination Team (TKPRD) in 2018. From an area of ​​850 Ha it is divided into smelter zones covering 154 Ha (100% land acquisition has been carried out by PT . AMNT) and smelter-derived industrial zones covering an area of ​​696 Ha (not entirely cleared);\nSmall and medium industrial zone (IKM) covering an area of ​​310 Ha.\nIn this case, the NTB Province BAPPEDA has always been cooperative and is willing to provide the data needed by the BPKP regarding the smelter construction plan. The Team for the Acceleration of Smelter Development and Its Derivative Industries, which consists of relevant stakeholders , both from the NTB Provincial Government and the West Sumbawa Regency Government, which has worked based on the NTB Governor's Decree since 2018, has carried out its duties to the fullest at the planning stage. For the implementation phase, there has been a change in the schedule for the completion of the smelter construction, which was originally planned to be completed in 2022, to be postponed to 2023. PT. AMNT explained that this was due to the Covid 19 pandemic, so that the progress of the smelter construction has not yet been significant. Regarding the decrease in production capacity of 1.3 MTPA (million tonnes per annual / million tonnes per year) to 0.9 MTPA, the Head of the ESDM Service explained that this was the authority of the central government.\nClosing the event, the Secretary of West Nusa Tenggara Province said that the NTB Provincial Government and West Sumbawa Regency Government must continue to oversee and immediately take care of accelerating the clarity of the status of Industrial Estates in West Sumbawa Regency, West Nusa Tenggara Province and it is hoped that clarity on the status of this industrial area will be obtained before the construction of a smelter and its derivative industries held.\"\n\nLombokpost.jawapos.com, 6/9/2021: Congratulations, West Sumbawa Enters the 2020-2024 National RPJM Industrial Area\n\"TALIWANG-West Sumbawa Regency (KSB) is designated as an industrial area and is included in the 2020-2024 medium-term development plan (RPJMN).\n“The smelter is only a small part. We have been designated as an industrial area. This means that there will be many other industries that will enter West Sumbawa,'' said KSB Regent HW. Musyafirin when meeting a number of Pokdarwis and IWAPI officials, yesterday (8/6).\nThe Regent hopes that the KSB community can seize this opportunity. Because the presence of this investment opens up new jobs for residents. ''For Eastern Indonesia, only we are included in the industrial area. This is a blessing for us, the people of West Sumbawa,'' he said.\nThe Regent again asked for the support of all KSB communities so that the presence of this industry is expected to run safely and smoothly. “That's why I always ask the community to support me. Don't just look at today, but how do we open our eyes to the future of our children and grandchildren,'' he remembers.\nThe Regent does not deny that the investment plan that has entered the KSB has so far received a negative impression from a number of parties. In fact, these investment plans are sometimes herded and dragged on as if they are only in the interests of the regent and deputy regent.\n''Even if there are accusations, it is for our personal interests. That's too much. The investment that we support and present is solely for the advancement of West Sumbawa,'' he said.

This was disclosed by West Sumbawa Regent Dr. Ir. H. W Musyafirin, MM at the KSB Government Yasinan Forum which was held at the Multipurpose Building of Bukit Damai Village, Maluk District, Thursday night (12/20/2018). Apart from being attended by the Regent and KSB Government officials and Forkopimda KSB, the Yasinan Forum in Zone IV (Jereweh, Maluk, Sekongkang) was also attended by the Head of the village, Mutual Cooperation agents, religious leaders, community leaders and residents of Maluk District, including the Head of Sekongkang Sub-District, Jereweh Sub-District Head, Mutual Cooperation Agents Royong and residents of the two sub-districts. The area of ​​1,200 to 1,500 hectares for the industrial area will include a smelter industry, fertilizer industry and other industries. In time, the NTB Provincial Government will conduct outreach to the public regarding the industrial area. Then any land, especially an area of ​​1,200 to 1,500 hectares, will be used as an industrial area. Therefore, the Regent continued, the people of Maluk District are expected to maintain the conduciveness that has been well maintained. In addition to making community activities run safely and comfortably, it is also to ensure the smooth investment climate, especially the establishment of an industrial area in Maluk District which will later have an impact on people's welfare. \"Regarding the road in Bukit Damai Village or in Maluk, Insya Allah in 2019 it will be worked on, people don't plant bananas on the road anymore, plant them in the right place,\" added the Regent. On various occasions the Village Head, The Gotong Royong agents and Maluk residents always stick together. Therefore, solidity or togetherness must be maintained and cared for as capital to build KSB. It is hoped that the Village Head, Gotong Royong Agents or all stakeholders in other Districts will be able to emulate the cohesiveness of the Government and the people of the Maluk District. Residents of Bukit Damai Village welcome the Regent's explanation regarding the environmental road improvement plan in 2019.
