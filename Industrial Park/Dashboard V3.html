The construction is halfway done, specifically 51.7 percent complete as of the end of December 2022. \n\"So the downstream and upstream sectors would become one. Refining copper domestically would boost the added values for the copper concentrate from the current 95 percent to 100 percent,” Freeport Indonesia president director Tony Wenas told BTV in a recent interview.\n“And also contribute to the EV ecosystem that is currently being built in Indonesia. Copper will play a pivotal role in the EV ecosystem,” Tony said.\nThe $3 billion Manyar Smelter is expected to process 1.7 million tons of copper concentrates a year. Freeport’s existing smelter PT Smelting has an annual capacity of a million tons of copper concentrates. Combined, Freeport Indonesia’s copper concentrate processing capacity can reach 3 million tons a year. Freeport Indonesia claimed the Manyar plant would become the world’s largest single-line smelter. \nThe Manyar Smelter is slated to begin commercial operations in end-2024, marking the end of copper concentrate ore exports from Freeport Indonesia.\" ", "Latitude": -7.086298, "Longitude": 112.607293 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 112.607293, -7.086298 ] } },

Meanwhile, KITW has a special status because it holds the status of a National Strategic Project (PSN) in accordance with Presidential Regulation (Perpres) 58 of 2017, so that processing regional permits can be made easier.  Wilmar Project and Technical Director Erik Tjia said that investment growth had indeed slowed down due to the pandemic, but it was predicted that it would soon increase after the economy recovered. He is optimistic that the growing economy will have a positive impact on industrial area businesses.  \"We hope that the value of incoming investment will continue to increase,\" said Erik Tjia in a press conference at KITW, Serang, Banten, Friday (28/10/2022).  \nKITW Serang has made a positive contribution to the region through paying regional taxes, absorbing 70 percent-80 percent of the workforce from local communities, and other multiplier-effects . Erik explained that of the total land reserved for the development of KITW covering an area of ​​800 ha, 200 ha had been utilized for Wilmar's interests, in the form of building factories for cooking oil, rice, margarine, biodiesel, flour, jetties, packaging and employee housing. \nApart from Wilmar, several investors have entered the area, such as Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) and PT Baja Putra Deli.

Currently, transport trucks have to pass through small roads and even residential areas to reach KITW.  Tenang further said that another double effect was the absorption of workers, which currently at KITW has reached around 2,000 people, including construction workers.

Unfortunately, he did not explain further the link between the liquidation of MJIS and the management's efforts to find new business partners.\n\"Currently MJIS has received approval to be liquidated, but before this liquidation is executed, we are looking for partners,\" said Silmy in a Hearing Meeting (RDP) with Commission VI DPR RI, Monday, April 11.\nFor your information, MJIS is a joint venture between Krakatau Steel and PT Aneka Tambang Tbk (ANTM), Meratus Jaya Iron &. This company was founded on June 9, 2008. The company is engaged in the industry and steel products, trade and services related to steel.\nMJIS is located in South Kalimantan by utilizing local iron ore reserves. In 2012, the company operated one unit of an iron factory (rotary kiln) from the planned two units, with a total capacity of 315,000 tons of direct reduced iron (DRI) per year.\nThe rotary kiln unit produces sponge iron which is processed from local iron ore. Meanwhile, the power plant has produced electricity using gas fuel from the rotary kiln factory unit. When it reaches full capacity, the electricity produced is 18 MW. In collaboration with PLN, this excess electricity will be distributed to the surrounding communities and small industries.\nHowever, MJIS experienced problems in its operation, in the form of limited infrastructure and delays in delivery of goods, installation and assembling of equipment. Because there was a commitment from the contractor PT Krakatau Engineering and shareholders, ANTM and KRAS were finally able to overcome these obstacles.\n\"But this can't be used because it's already inefficient and the location is far from further production,\" he said.\nQuoted from the Meratus Jaya website, this company has been operating since 2008 and has stopped operating due to falling iron ore prices on the world market. Thus, the selling price is not competitive.\nThis company has also been in production for approximately 3 years and has made the first shipment of sponge iron products of 5,000 metric tons to Krakatau Steel.\n\"Krakatau Steel itself, we no longer use sponge iron,\" he said.\"\n\n(Mariono, 2022, kalsel.antaranews.com): \"'Regarding KI Batulicin, it consists of block one and block two.

In response to the plan to build a smelter, Zairullah Azhar HM, Regent of Tanbu, continues to provide support.\"\n\n(Trihusodo, 2021, Indonesia.go.id): Bright Industrial Prospects in Batulicin\n\"A biodiesel plant operates in the Batulicin Industrial area. In the same place, the iron ore smelter is being revitalized. \"The government continues to push for an increase in biodiesel.\nIn the third week of August 2021, President Jokowi inaugurated a biodiesel factory in the Batulicin City industrial area, Tanah Bumbu Regency, South Kalimantan Province. The factory, which stands on an industrial area of ​​2,000 ha, is directly connected to the beach. The factory processes crude palm oil (CPO) into 1,500 tons of biodiesel per day, and was built with an investment of IDR 2 trillion.\nThe Batulicin biofuel industry is owned by Haji Isam, the popular name of businessman Syamsudin Andi Arsyad, who is known as the richest man and concurrently the coal king of South Kalimantan. ''I am willing to come here because this industry can open up great job opportunities,'' President Jokowi said in his remarks.\nSecond, he continued, the downstream industry can maintain the stability of palm oil prices, both in the domestic and international markets. Palm oil has a wider market. ''That way, the price can be more stable. Don't let our goods be owned, but the market will determine the price,'' said President Jokowi.\nPresident Jokowi also said that the Jhonlin Group's initiative to build a biodiesel factory was a downstream step for raw commodities that had to be encouraged. The head of state also hopes that PT Jhonlin and other business groups can conduct downstream activities more broadly. ''Either used as cooking oil, cosmetics, or other finished goods. I appreciate what PT Jhonlin Group has done, which certainly provides great added value,' said Jokowi...\nIndustrial area\nIn his report to President Jokowi, Commissioner of PT Jhonlin Agro Raya Andi Amran Sulaiman, (former Indonesian Minister of Agriculture 2014-2019), said that the biodiesel industry in Batulicin, with all its supporting industries upstream, can absorb up to 20,000 workers. There are thousands of others who are indirectly related to the industrial business.\nIt is also believed that the biodiesel industry will revive the prestige of the dim Batulicin Industrial Area. The industrial area itself is part of the PT Jhonlin Group business. According to Amran, the smelter will operate again in the area which will process iron sand (iron rock) into iron billets for the steel industry. The raw material for iron sand and iron stone itself is quite a lot in South Kalimantan, especially on Derawan Island, Sebuku Island, besides there are many others available in Central Sulawesi.\nThe smelter industry Amran Sulaiman refers to belongs to PT Meratus Jaya Iron and Steel (MJIS), a joint venture between two BUMNs, namely PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk and PT Aneka Tambang Tbk . The smelter operated for several years before closing in 2015 due to falling steel prices on the market. Occupying an area of ​​120 ha in Batulicin, the smelter owned by PT Meratus Jaya is currently being revitalized and is expected to return to production in 2023.\nThe Batulicin Industrial Area is one of 120 industrial areas in Indonesia, and the only one in South Kalimantan. It is not surprising that the South Kalimantan Provincial Government and Tanah Bumbu Regency Government have encouraged the industrial area to continue to develop.\nCurrently, Kotabaru Port in Batulicin has entered the sea highway network, and is one of 33 ports in the sea highway network equipped with Inaportnet 4.0 infrastructure. Kotabaru Port has also been equipped with warehouses, passenger terminals, container terminals, and can serve ships with large tonnages. Bersujud Airport in Batulicin City also has a runway that is 1,850 meters long, only an additional 100-200 meters is needed for Boeing 737s to land on it.\nHowever, compared to those standing in East Kalimantan, the Batulicin Industrial Area is still quiet. Apart from the biodiesel factory, cooking oil factory and iron ore smelter which are currently being restored using the latest technology, the Batulicin Industrial Area is only inhabited by a handful of medium-scale factories. PT Jhonlin Group, for example, also operates a rubber and wood pellet processing industry, from wood industry waste, which is used as fuel for heating stoves in four-season homes. The wood pellets are exported to Europe.\nThere are still many industries that can be accommodated. The need for clean water for industry is easy to obtain. Electricity supply is also available in sufficient quantities, available from the Barito power grid, with the back pole of the Bengkanai PLTG in Central Kalimantan.\nPresident Jokowi also reminded the importance of upholding the commitment to abandon fossil energy and switch to new, renewable energy. Therefore, the President encouraged biodiesel production to continue to be increased. Andi Amran Sulaiman, as the Main Commissioner of PT Jhonlin Agro Raya, has invited industry players to enter Batulicin.\nThe biodiesel industry itself will continue to develop in the country. 'In 2021, our target is to be able to produce and distribute 9.2 million kiloliters, and I hope that next year it can increase even higher,\" said President Jokowi. PT Jhonlin's biodiesel factory may be facing a fairly bright business situation.\"", "Latitude": -3.284766552, "Longitude": 116.0656929 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 116.0656929, -3.284766552 ] } },

The $2bn project is expected to consume at least 6mn t/yr of coal to produce 1.8mn t/yr of methanol once operational, Bumi said.\nThe new gasification facility will be built at the Batuta Chemical Industrial Park (BCIP) located in Bengalon, east Kalimantan, Bumi added. The area is currently undergoing the second stage of land clearing in preparation for actual construction of the plant to begin. The facility is targeted for completion by late 2025 or early 2026.\nUnder an initial agreement by both companies, Bumi will supply coal for the facility through its Kaltim Prima Coal (KPC) mining subsidiary and its Ithaca Resources' Kaltim Nusantara Coal subsidiary. Both companies will be responsible for the offtake of the methanol produced, while Air Products will be the builder, owner, and operator of the facility.\nIndonesia's energy ministry (ESDM) welcomed the development of the new gasification facility, saying that these types of projects will help accelerate investments in the growing downstream coal sector.\nInvestments remain low because of the significant financial undertaking needed, as well as the lack of an existing market for coal derivative products, the ESDM said. The ESDM is hoping that the commercial operations of two large-scale coal gasification plants will demonstrate the economic feasibility of the downstream coal sector to industry players.\nThe methanol produced by the plant is expected to help reduce imports, and increase the value of lower-quality coal produced in Indonesia.\"\n\n(Media Kaltim, 2022, mediakaltim.com): A coal-to-methanol processing plant will soon be built in Kutim\n\"The government has started the construction of a coal gasification industry into dimethyl ether (DME) in East Kutai.

[1]\nThe estate is publicly owned and operated. Tenants include companies in the food processing and manufacturing industries. They enjoy various tax and regulatory incentives, as well as access to transportation infrastructure.\nHistory of the Zone\nIn 1988, the Indonesian government created the Makassar Industrial Estate.[2]\nThe estate was created at a time of rapid economic growth in Indonesia. President Suharto, who governed Indonesia from 1968 until 1998, made significant reforms to the economy. Indonesia’s GDP grew from $7 billion USD in 1968 to $84 billion USD in 1988.\nIn the late 1980s, the Indonesian government passed several reforms to increase exports such as devaluing the currency. Notably, in 1989, the government created SEZ-style “Industrial Estates.” Restrictions on foreign investment within the estates were relaxed. The reforms were successful.[5] The GDP per capita of Indonesia grew 550% during the 1990s, and annual GDP growth averaged at 7%.[6]\nPlans for the Makassar Industrial Estate go as far back as 1975, with the growth of the business park mostly occurring in the 1990s and early 2000s. The estate started producing cacao and flour in the early 2000s.[15]\nIn April 2019, the Makassar New Port opened several kilometers from the estate.[2] Recently there have been plans to expand zone because most of the existing plots have already been sold out.[4]\nNotable Tenants\nAs of 2020, there are 270 businesses operating within the industrial estate, 27 of which are Japanese companies.[2] The tenants belong to the following industries: seafood processing, cold storage, animal feed, and agricultural processing.[2]\nOne notable tenant is Indofood, one of Indonesia’s largest food processors. Another notable tenant is Plastindo, a large plastic packaging manufacturer.\nManagement of the Zone\n‍The Makassar Industrial Estate is managed by Kawasan Industri Makassar (KIMA).\nKIMA is a state owned enterprise which manages Makassar as well as several other industrial estates on the island of Sulawesi.[1] 60% of the company is owned by the Indonesian government, the Government of South Sulawesi owns 30% of the shares, and the remaining 10% is owned by the Makassar city government.[2] It is regulated by the Indonesian Ministry of State Owned Enterprises.[1]\nMain Incentives\n‍The laws that currently govern the Makassar Industrial estate are Law 39 from 2009 and Government Regulation 40 from 2021.[2][7][8][9]\nCompanies located in the zone can take advantage of the following incentives:\nThe ability to write off various investments from the corporate income tax\nAccelerated depreciation and amortization of assets\nA 10% tax on dividends\nStreamlined import / export regulations\nEasy access to business VISAs\n0% interest rates on loans for land purchases\nThe minimum wage for tenants has been reduced from 4.4 million IDR / month ($305) to 2.9 million IDR ($200)\nKIMA (the management company) will handle environmental impact assessments\n‍Infrastructure\n‍As of early 2020, the zone covers an area of 336 hectares, although there are plans for expansion.[2] The estate provides electricity, clean water, telecommunications, medical clinics, warehouses, and has a fire station. The estate also helps its tenants with construction by providing transportation or rental of equipment. The park is also the only industrial area in Sulawesi that has a liquid waste treatment process.[10]‍\nAs for location, the zone is 5 km away from the Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, 18 km away from the Soekarno Hatta Seaport, 7.6 km away from the train station, and 1.8 km away from the main road.[2]\nCorporate Social Responsibilities\n‍The Makassar Industrial Estate’s management company, KIMA, has created various corporate social responsibility programs.[12] These include:\n-KIMA Green, a program that seeks to reduce air pollution by planting trees and reducing tenant emissions\n-Financing for local entrepreneurs\n-An Educational Assistance Program\n-​​A Free Rice ATM which gives ATM cards to the community that can be used to withdraw 5 liters of free rice every 2 weeks\nEffects of COVID-19\nFor the few months of the pandemic, the estate had difficulties importing raw materials for processing. The breakdown of the global supply chain caused many tenants to be starved for inputs.[14] Consequently, KIMA suffered financially. The park’s financial performance in 2020 dropped compared to their performanced in 2018. Net profit in 2020 had shrunk by 10% compared to the previous year.[13]\nPlanned Expansion\n‍In early 2019, the Ministry of Investment announced that they would expand the zone from 336 hectares to 1000 hectares. Existing plots were almost entirely sold out, and the estate found itself unable to accommodate new investors seeking to enter. A second location, called KIMA 2, is scheduled to be built elsewhere in the city Makassar.[11] The Makassar Industrial Estate is also working to modernize its logistics systems.\nConclusion\n‍The Makassar Industrial Estate is one of Indonesia’s fastest growing SEZs, and will likely continue playing a major role in the region over the next decade.\"\n\n\n", "Latitude": -5.104643, "Longitude": 119.497902 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 119.497902, -5.104643 ] } },

In Routa District, Regent Kery facilitated the entry of PT.Sulawesi Cahaya Mineral (SCM) through the flag of PT.Indonesia Konawe Industrial Park (IKIP) which invested around IDR 58 trillion in capital. Mining activities in Routa are currently underway. PT.IKIP will explore over the mining business permit area (IUP) owned by PT.SCM, which is an area of ​​3,563 hectares. The corporation is currently building an industrial complex with various other supporting infrastructure. \nThe presence of investment in Routa is projected to absorb around six to eight thousand workers. It is believed that the absorption of so many workers will alleviate unemployment. Routa, which was previously branded as a marginal area, is now predicted to become a developed area thanks to the influx of investment in the region. \nKonawe Regent Kery Saiful Konggoasa said, through private investment in Routa, nickel factories and other derivatives will be built in that area. This includes nickel derivatives, namely lithium, which is used as a raw material for making electric vehicle batteries. \"We are grateful for the investment in Routa. We need the investment in order to accelerate regional progress. This investment will also help us overcome employment problems in Konawe,\" Regent Kery told Kendari Pos yesterday. \nMeanwhile, Konawe Secretary (Sekab) Konawe Ferdinand Sapan stated, PT.SCM has so far continued to improve the progress of the development of industrial estates in Routa.

Thus, when corporations build their industrial estates or other supporting areas related to industry, it will have a positive impact on the community. That's why, we have to prepare the RDTR from the start ,\" he explained. \nWith that support, said Ferdinand Sapan, PT.SCM will consistently prioritize all the potential that exists in Konawe to support the company's production activities. Whether it's the potential of natural resources (SDA) or human resources (HR). \nThe former Head of BPKAD Konawe admitted that on various occasions when he met delegations from PT. SCM, he always asked the corporation to prioritize local potential rather than looking elsewhere. \"One of the things I conveyed to the company, if they need to eat there and still eat from rice, never buy rice from other places. They have to buy rice from Konawe. Later, if Konawe can't afford it, then look elsewhere,\" said Ferdinand Sapa. He said, to further strengthen the commitment between the government and the private sector regarding investment in Routa, the Konawe Regency Government will also make a memorandum of understanding with PT.SCM. For example, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) related to the concept of managing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds which is the responsibility of the company. \n\"So we use methods like that. The MoU includes the education sector. Later we will try to convey that our human resources need to be pushed or increased in level.

SCM, 2,500 workers had been recruited to build the mega industrial complex in the westernmost region of Konawe. But the problem going forward, he continued, is when corporations need skilled workers (skills). Meanwhile, the readiness of Konawe's human resources with special skills is still relatively low. \"One of the things we have prepared is the later integration of the need for skilled workers from the Polytechnic in Morosi.

The AMMAN Group includes PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (PT AMNT) which operates the Batu Hijau mine and PT Amman Mineral Industri (PT AMIN) which builds and operates a smelter facility...\"\n\nVoi.id, 11/7/2022: Construction Of Amman Mineral Smelter In West Sumbawa Is Almost Capai 50 Percent, Targeted By Rampung In 2024\n\"The metal mineral processing plant (smelter) construction project developed by PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (AMMAN), until early November 2022 almost reached 50 percent.\nThe amount of funds that have been disbursed has reached 465 million dollars out of the total investment requirement estimated at US $ 982 million or equivalent to Rp. 14.7 trillion.\nHead of Corporate Communications of PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara, Kartika Octaviana said the construction of the smelter was completed in 2024 from the initial projection set by the government in June 2023.\nKartika added, the construction of a smelter in Batu Hijau, West Sumbawa Regency, West Nusa Tenggara, should have been delayed a little from the schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis creates a number of face-to-face meetings to discuss the specifications of delayed smelter engineering and engineering which will have an impact on the construction work timeline, as well as delays in the negotiation process and financial statement decision.\n\"As a result, the mobilization of large equipment and equipment that is very important for the construction of smelters, especially from Europe, has been delayed from the initial schedule,\" Kartika said as quoted by Antara, Monday, November 7.\nThis year, Kartika continued, the challenges are even greater with the Ukraine-Russia conflict affecting the delay in supply chain, in the form of increasing cost of mobilizing goods and humans, lack of containers, to closing ports.\nConsidering that almost 50 percent of investment has been disbursed, Kartika continued, it is impossible for the mineral mining company, which is affiliated with PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk, to withdraw from the smelter project.\n\"This means that we remain committed to completing the construction of the smelter, especially since the funding is also available,\" he said.\nThe Green Stone smelter project is projected to have a production capacity of 222,000 tons of copper cathode. In addition, the smelter will produce 17.8 tons of gold, 54.7 tons of silver and 830.000 sulfate acid.\nAMMAN's Head of Social Impact Priyo Pramono added that the six-month verification achievement always exceeded the target and the construction of the camp was completed in October 2022.\n\"The smelter construction and supporting facilities have also started since July 2022 with the installation of stake poles, including the installation of special water facilities, in the form of desalized water and dem generalization. The mobilization of contractors to the construction area has also been carried out,\" he said.\nPriyo added that the purchase order for the long lead equipment has been executed. Moreover, there has been a signing of an agreement to finance syndicates from banks and companies that have processed recruitment in stages according to the construction stage, in collaboration with the West Sumbawa Regency Government (KSB) and NTB.\"\n\n8/11/2022: KSB \"All Out\" Helps Realize Smelter Development\n\"The Regional Government of West Sumbawa Regency (KSB) is making every effort to help create a smelter or metal mineral smelting industry which is currently in the process of preparing for development. Moreover, in accordance with President Jokowi's directives, that all regional leaders must support the acceleration of investment in their respective regions.\nKSB Regent Dr. HW Musyafirin said that the smelter in this area will later trigger a derivative industry that can move the economy even faster. So that in this preparation process, the KSB Regional Government together with the NTB Provincial Government and PT. Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (AMNT) actively communicates with the central government so that all processes run smoothly.\nHe said the location for the smelter construction was in Otak Keris Hamlet, Maluk District, KSB. Maluk District itself has been designated by the central government as a priority industrial area along with 26 other priority industrial areas in Indonesia.\n\"The Maluk District has been decided to become an industrial area out of 27 priority industrial areas to be built in Indonesia and it is included in the national medium-term development plan for 2020-2024,\" said HW Musyafirin in a special interview with Suara NTB recently.\nIn order to create an industrial area, including for the construction of a smelter, the Regional Government of KSB has the principle that there should be no obstacles, especially those that come from the government. The government must go all out to provide support.\n''So from the start we were with the Regional Leadership Communication Forum, where there were the Chair of the PN, the Chair of the DPRD, the Kajari, the Head of the Police and the Dandim all out to help,'' said the Regent.\nHe said, PT. AMNT has written a letter to KSB containing a request for facilitation of land acquisition in Otak Keris Hamlet, which incidentally is a village area. Initially the Regional Government of KSB hoped that the Smelter could be built in the coastal area, especially where PT. AMNT already owns around 200 hectares of land.\n''However, technically the location did not meet the requirements, so during the trip the Otak Keris area was chosen, even though this is a village area,'' he said.\nOtak Keris is included in the plan to establish an industrial area with an area of ​​1,164 hectares. Because it will be used as an industrial zone, land in hamlets with around 60 families is included in the land acquisition priority.\n''What was needed at that time was 150 hectares, plus another 20 hectares. So more or less what we have freed is around 170 hectares, and it's all clear . Until the last, around 61 hectares, the settlement was through the courts. It's already inrah, the decision from the Supreme Court has also been passed,''explained the Regent.\nMusyafirin admitted that he is very optimistic that this smelter will definitely be realized, especially since his party has moved very far to realize this project. It's just that the Covid-19 pandemic has hampered this program a bit, but in principle this smelter will still be built according to plan.\nCurrently, in preparation for the construction of a smelter, camps or workers' camps are being built with a total of around 2000 – 3000 camps. An engaged workforce with prioritizing local labour. Even now, the Integrated Team tasked with recruiting workers is currently selecting around 1,200 workers for smelter preparation.\n Regarding the proportion of local workers in the construction of this smelter, the Regional Government of KSB certainly prioritizes local workers and local resources for company needs. Likewise other resources such as building materials and food needs so that PT. AMNT absorbs the maximum from the local community.\n“In every meeting with AMNT, we always convey that local resources must be a priority. Local resources such as materials, sand, crushed stone, as well as local materials such as rice, vegetables and others. Including labor resources, it must be prioritized from KSB,\" he said.\nThe KSB Regent admitted that he had drafted a regional regulation so that it was the responsibility of the company, and all sub-contractors working in KSB to use local human resources of at least 40 percent. Prior to drafting this Perda, a Perbup first appeared which required companies to absorb local workers and other local resources with a minimum amount of 60 percent.\n“However, we will make a regional regulation for a minimum of 40 percent of resources. Moreover, the central government has asked that spending on local products be at least 40 percent in the regional budget. We try to comply with regulations,\" he explained.\nThe Regional Government of KSB has conducted a comparative study in Gresik, East Java to take a close look at the smelter industry there and its derivative industries. The Department of Manpower has been given orders to train local workers to become skilled by inviting the involvement of PT. AMNT.

From the results of the survey, 4 aspects were obtained which had sufficient evidence, namely; licensing/non-licensing aspects, project preparation aspects, spatial planning aspects and land provision aspects. While the other 9 aspects, namely funding, government guarantees, procurement of goods/services, project development implementation, prioritizing domestic components, supervision and control, project regulations, work creation aspects and aspects of utilization do not yet have strong evidence or supporting data.\nIt is hoped that the BPKP will be able to obtain updated information from the NTB Provincial Government, West Sumbawa Regency Government and PT. Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (PT. AMNT) so that BPKP can carry out a comprehensive and integrated cross-sector supervisory role in overseeing the Development of Industrial Estates in West Sumbawa Regency which can ultimately fulfill development accountability in achieving the RPJMN project targets, the NTB Provincial RPJMD and the President's priority programs.\nThe current issues of smelter development discussed include:\nThe issue of land acquisition, where in the 154 hectares of land for smelter construction there is still land that has not been acquired;\nChanges to the construction schedule and completion of the smelter construction which was originally planned to be completed in 2022 to 2023;\nChange in production capacity from 1.3 MTPA to 0.9 MTPA;\nThe progress of the smelter development has not been significant.\nIn response to this problem, the NTB Provincial BAPPEDA represented by the Young Expert Planning Functional (B. Sri Ratna Setiawati, ST, M.Eng.) said that the Industrial Area of ​​West Sumbawa Regency had been listed in the Revised RTRW of NTB Province as a Provincial Strategic Area from the point of view of growth interests economy. In addition, in the Spatial Pattern Plan, both the Revised RTRW for the Province of NTB and the Regional Regulation on the RTRW for West Sumbawa Regency, it is stated that the area of ​​the West Sumbawa Regency Industrial Area is 1,160 Ha, which is divided into several zones, as follows:\nThe smelter zone and its derivative industries cover an area of ​​850 Ha which has received recommendations for suitability for spatial use from the NTB Provincial Spatial Planning Coordination Team (TKPRD) in 2018. From an area of ​​850 Ha it is divided into smelter zones covering 154 Ha (100% land acquisition has been carried out by PT . AMNT) and smelter-derived industrial zones covering an area of ​​696 Ha (not entirely cleared);\nSmall and medium industrial zone (IKM) covering an area of ​​310 Ha.\nIn this case, the NTB Province BAPPEDA has always been cooperative and is willing to provide the data needed by the BPKP regarding the smelter construction plan. The Team for the Acceleration of Smelter Development and Its Derivative Industries, which consists of relevant stakeholders , both from the NTB Provincial Government and the West Sumbawa Regency Government, which has worked based on the NTB Governor's Decree since 2018, has carried out its duties to the fullest at the planning stage. For the implementation phase, there has been a change in the schedule for the completion of the smelter construction, which was originally planned to be completed in 2022, to be postponed to 2023. PT. AMNT explained that this was due to the Covid 19 pandemic, so that the progress of the smelter construction has not yet been significant. Regarding the decrease in production capacity of 1.3 MTPA (million tonnes per annual / million tonnes per year) to 0.9 MTPA, the Head of the ESDM Service explained that this was the authority of the central government.\nClosing the event, the Secretary of West Nusa Tenggara Province said that the NTB Provincial Government and West Sumbawa Regency Government must continue to oversee and immediately take care of accelerating the clarity of the status of Industrial Estates in West Sumbawa Regency, West Nusa Tenggara Province and it is hoped that clarity on the status of this industrial area will be obtained before the construction of a smelter and its derivative industries held.\"\n\nLombokpost.jawapos.com, 6/9/2021: Congratulations, West Sumbawa Enters the 2020-2024 National RPJM Industrial Area\n\"TALIWANG-West Sumbawa Regency (KSB) is designated as an industrial area and is included in the 2020-2024 medium-term development plan (RPJMN).\n“The smelter is only a small part.
