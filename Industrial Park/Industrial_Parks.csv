Trenasia, August 2020: ""The Coordinating Ministry (Kemenko) for the Economy asked Sinopec Group to immediately realize the construction of an oil depot which has been stalled for 8 years in Batam, Riau Archipelago.
""Sinomart KTS Development Ltd or a subsidiary of Sinopec and PT Batam Sentralindo have agreed to continue the investment plan for the construction of an oil depot in Batam,"" said Secretary of the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs Susiwijono in Jakarta, Saturday, August 1 2020.
The agreement, said Susi, had been contained in a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by both parties on July 29, 2020. On this occasion, his party was also present as a witness as well as a form of escort for the realization of the oil depot project.
""The Coordinating Ministry for the Economy and BP Batam acted as mediators for the two companies. We will continue to oversee the preparation process until the physical construction so that it can be carried out immediately,"" he added.

Trenasia, June 2020: ""We have developed WMIP industrial estate with its strategic and geographic advantages in Batam. Some 75 hectares in WMIP have already been leased by Sinopec Group for the development of oil storage terminal with capacity of 2,6 million m3, explained Paulus Khierawan, Senior Manager at PT. Batam Sentralindo in Batam, June 14, 2020.
Paulus explained, the location of WMIP industrial estate is approximately 4,8 km from the Strait of Malacca with sea depth of 23 – 25 metres. Due to its competitive advantages, WMIP can accommodate 300,000-DWT VLCC – Very Large Crude Carrier. In line with the company’s Industrial Estate Business License (IUKI), the integrated industrial park can be developed up to 320 hectares.
There are 245 hectares of land area currently in preparation at WMIP which are suitable for the development of oil refinery and its downstream integration such as petrochemicals, and even methanol plants which utilize natural gas as feedstock from the nearby Natuna Islands. As developer, we welcome oil and gas investors to Batam which also has its incentives with its Free Trade and Free Port Zone (FTZ) status,” Paulus explained.",Stalled,,,,,,,,,,Petrochemical,"oil and gas, petrochemicals, methanol",

news.klikbekasi.co, 10/22/2015: It has been proven that the Bekasi Hyundai Industrial Area pollutes the environment
Bekasi International Industrial Estate (BIIE) or known as the Hyundai Industrial area has been proven to have polluted the surrounding environment. The disposal of factory liquid waste at Hyundai is not in accordance with regulations.
""Hyundai admits its guilt,"" said Head of the Civil and Administrative Section of the Cikarang District Attorney Rolando Ritonga recently.
Rolando said, Hyundai did not extend the liquid waste disposal permit (IPL C). Hyundai's industrial waste has also exceeded the quality standard threshold.
""Results of a study by the Ministry of Environment, the Cikadu river, which flows into the CBL river to the sea, is experiencing extraordinary pollution due to Hyundai's waste disposal,"" said Rolando.
The lawsuit was then settled for Rp. 2 billion
On June 6, 2014, the Bekasi Regency Government sued PT Hyundai Inti Development in a civil lawsuit with a compensation value of IDR 16 billion.
PT Hyundai Inti Development is the manager of the Hyundai industrial area and is responsible for permitting the disposal of liquid waste from local factories.
The value of IDR 16 billion is determined based on calculations from the Ministry of Environment experts. ""Compensation is calculated from 2010 to February 2014,"" said Rolando.
Initially, the government and Hyundai negotiated out of court. Hyundai stated that it was only able to pay compensation of 147 million. The government refused.
Hyundai then increased its offer to Rp 200 million, but the government still refused. Finally, Hyundai agreed to Rp 400 million. The government still refuses.
“Finally brought to court. The government and Hyundai agreed on a figure of Rp 2 billion. It must be paid no later than November 2015. The money goes to the regional administration,"" said Rolando.
In addition to paying Rp 2 billion, Hyundai is required to repair the sewage system so there will be no more pollution. Within 8 months, the canal repair should be completed.
""If it doesn't complete the repairs within the allotted time, Hyundai will have to pay Rp 5 billion. That's the deal,"" he said.
PT Hyundai Inti Development's lawyer, Army Mulyanto, explained that his client had paid Rp. 1 billion to the West Java Bank (BJB) account belonging to the Bekasi Regency Government.
""Hyundai has paid Rp. 1 billion in early October. The drawback, another Rp. 1 billion, is paid no later than 30 days after the first payment,"" said Army.
According to the Army, Hyundai is also working on repairing the sewage channel that will flow into the Cikadu River as agreed with the government.
“Hyundai will fulfill all the agreements. As for channel repairs, Hyundai is currently repairing them,"" said Army.
Just to note, the Hyundai Bekasi industrial area was built by PT Hyundai Inti Development on an area of ​​200 hectares in Bekasi Regency and was operational in 1991.
PT Hyundai Inti Development is a joint venture between Hyundai Corporation (South Korea) and PT. Lippo Cikarang Tbk.
PT Lippo Cikarang Tbk (Lippo Group) itself is a company that owns and manages a number of industrial estates in Bekasi Regency. These include the EJIP industrial area, Delta Silicon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. This includes Hyundai.
