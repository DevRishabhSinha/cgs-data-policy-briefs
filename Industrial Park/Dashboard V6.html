The construction is halfway done, specifically 51.7 percent complete as of the end of December 2022. \n\"So the downstream and upstream sectors would become one. Refining copper domestically would boost the added values for the copper concentrate from the current 95 percent to 100 percent,” Freeport Indonesia president director Tony Wenas told BTV in a recent interview.\n“And also contribute to the EV ecosystem that is currently being built in Indonesia. Copper will play a pivotal role in the EV ecosystem,” Tony said.\nThe $3 billion Manyar Smelter is expected to process 1.7 million tons of copper concentrates a year. Freeport’s existing smelter PT Smelting has an annual capacity of a million tons of copper concentrates. Combined, Freeport Indonesia’s copper concentrate processing capacity can reach 3 million tons a year. Freeport Indonesia claimed the Manyar plant would become the world’s largest single-line smelter. \nThe Manyar Smelter is slated to begin commercial operations in end-2024, marking the end of copper concentrate ore exports from Freeport Indonesia.\" ", "Latitude": -7.086298, "Longitude": 112.607293 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 112.607293, -7.086298 ] } },

Meanwhile, KITW has a special status because it holds the status of a National Strategic Project (PSN) in accordance with Presidential Regulation (Perpres) 58 of 2017, so that processing regional permits can be made easier.  Wilmar Project and Technical Director Erik Tjia said that investment growth had indeed slowed down due to the pandemic, but it was predicted that it would soon increase after the economy recovered. He is optimistic that the growing economy will have a positive impact on industrial area businesses.  \"We hope that the value of incoming investment will continue to increase,\" said Erik Tjia in a press conference at KITW, Serang, Banten, Friday (28/10/2022).  \nKITW Serang has made a positive contribution to the region through paying regional taxes, absorbing 70 percent-80 percent of the workforce from local communities, and other multiplier-effects . Erik explained that of the total land reserved for the development of KITW covering an area of ​​800 ha, 200 ha had been utilized for Wilmar's interests, in the form of building factories for cooking oil, rice, margarine, biodiesel, flour, jetties, packaging and employee housing. \nApart from Wilmar, several investors have entered the area, such as Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) and PT Baja Putra Deli.

Currently, transport trucks have to pass through small roads and even residential areas to reach KITW.  Tenang further said that another double effect was the absorption of workers, which currently at KITW has reached around 2,000 people, including construction workers.

Unfortunately, he did not explain further the link between the liquidation of MJIS and the management's efforts to find new business partners.\n\"Currently MJIS has received approval to be liquidated, but before this liquidation is executed, we are looking for partners,\" said Silmy in a Hearing Meeting (RDP) with Commission VI DPR RI, Monday, April 11.\nFor your information, MJIS is a joint venture between Krakatau Steel and PT Aneka Tambang Tbk (ANTM), Meratus Jaya Iron &. This company was founded on June 9, 2008. The company is engaged in the industry and steel products, trade and services related to steel.\nMJIS is located in South Kalimantan by utilizing local iron ore reserves. In 2012, the company operated one unit of an iron factory (rotary kiln) from the planned two units, with a total capacity of 315,000 tons of direct reduced iron (DRI) per year.\nThe rotary kiln unit produces sponge iron which is processed from local iron ore. Meanwhile, the power plant has produced electricity using gas fuel from the rotary kiln factory unit. When it reaches full capacity, the electricity produced is 18 MW. In collaboration with PLN, this excess electricity will be distributed to the surrounding communities and small industries.\nHowever, MJIS experienced problems in its operation, in the form of limited infrastructure and delays in delivery of goods, installation and assembling of equipment. Because there was a commitment from the contractor PT Krakatau Engineering and shareholders, ANTM and KRAS were finally able to overcome these obstacles.\n\"But this can't be used because it's already inefficient and the location is far from further production,\" he said.\nQuoted from the Meratus Jaya website, this company has been operating since 2008 and has stopped operating due to falling iron ore prices on the world market. Thus, the selling price is not competitive.\nThis company has also been in production for approximately 3 years and has made the first shipment of sponge iron products of 5,000 metric tons to Krakatau Steel.\n\"Krakatau Steel itself, we no longer use sponge iron,\" he said.\"\n\n(Mariono, 2022, kalsel.antaranews.com): \"'Regarding KI Batulicin, it consists of block one and block two.

In the same place, the iron ore smelter is being revitalized. \"The government continues to push for an increase in biodiesel.\nIn the third week of August 2021, President Jokowi inaugurated a biodiesel factory in the Batulicin City industrial area, Tanah Bumbu Regency, South Kalimantan Province. The factory, which stands on an industrial area of ​​2,000 ha, is directly connected to the beach. The factory processes crude palm oil (CPO) into 1,500 tons of biodiesel per day, and was built with an investment of IDR 2 trillion.\nThe Batulicin biofuel industry is owned by Haji Isam, the popular name of businessman Syamsudin Andi Arsyad, who is known as the richest man and concurrently the coal king of South Kalimantan. ''I am willing to come here because this industry can open up great job opportunities,'' President Jokowi said in his remarks.\nSecond, he continued, the downstream industry can maintain the stability of palm oil prices, both in the domestic and international markets. Palm oil has a wider market. ''That way, the price can be more stable. Don't let our goods be owned, but the market will determine the price,'' said President Jokowi.\nPresident Jokowi also said that the Jhonlin Group's initiative to build a biodiesel factory was a downstream step for raw commodities that had to be encouraged. The head of state also hopes that PT Jhonlin and other business groups can conduct downstream activities more broadly. ''Either used as cooking oil, cosmetics, or other finished goods. I appreciate what PT Jhonlin Group has done, which certainly provides great added value,' said Jokowi...\nIndustrial area\nIn his report to President Jokowi, Commissioner of PT Jhonlin Agro Raya Andi Amran Sulaiman, (former Indonesian Minister of Agriculture 2014-2019), said that the biodiesel industry in Batulicin, with all its supporting industries upstream, can absorb up to 20,000 workers. There are thousands of others who are indirectly related to the industrial business.\nIt is also believed that the biodiesel industry will revive the prestige of the dim Batulicin Industrial Area. The industrial area itself is part of the PT Jhonlin Group business. According to Amran, the smelter will operate again in the area which will process iron sand (iron rock) into iron billets for the steel industry. The raw material for iron sand and iron stone itself is quite a lot in South Kalimantan, especially on Derawan Island, Sebuku Island, besides there are many others available in Central Sulawesi.\nThe smelter industry Amran Sulaiman refers to belongs to PT Meratus Jaya Iron and Steel (MJIS), a joint venture between two BUMNs, namely PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk and PT Aneka Tambang Tbk . The smelter operated for several years before closing in 2015 due to falling steel prices on the market. Occupying an area of ​​120 ha in Batulicin, the smelter owned by PT Meratus Jaya is currently being revitalized and is expected to return to production in 2023.\nThe Batulicin Industrial Area is one of 120 industrial areas in Indonesia, and the only one in South Kalimantan. It is not surprising that the South Kalimantan Provincial Government and Tanah Bumbu Regency Government have encouraged the industrial area to continue to develop.\nCurrently, Kotabaru Port in Batulicin has entered the sea highway network, and is one of 33 ports in the sea highway network equipped with Inaportnet 4.0 infrastructure. Kotabaru Port has also been equipped with warehouses, passenger terminals, container terminals, and can serve ships with large tonnages. Bersujud Airport in Batulicin City also has a runway that is 1,850 meters long, only an additional 100-200 meters is needed for Boeing 737s to land on it.\nHowever, compared to those standing in East Kalimantan, the Batulicin Industrial Area is still quiet. Apart from the biodiesel factory, cooking oil factory and iron ore smelter which are currently being restored using the latest technology, the Batulicin Industrial Area is only inhabited by a handful of medium-scale factories. PT Jhonlin Group, for example, also operates a rubber and wood pellet processing industry, from wood industry waste, which is used as fuel for heating stoves in four-season homes. The wood pellets are exported to Europe.\nThere are still many industries that can be accommodated. The need for clean water for industry is easy to obtain. Electricity supply is also available in sufficient quantities, available from the Barito power grid, with the back pole of the Bengkanai PLTG in Central Kalimantan.\nPresident Jokowi also reminded the importance of upholding the commitment to abandon fossil energy and switch to new, renewable energy. Therefore, the President encouraged biodiesel production to continue to be increased.

The $2bn project is expected to consume at least 6mn t/yr of coal to produce 1.8mn t/yr of methanol once operational, Bumi said.\nThe new gasification facility will be built at the Batuta Chemical Industrial Park (BCIP) located in Bengalon, east Kalimantan, Bumi added. The area is currently undergoing the second stage of land clearing in preparation for actual construction of the plant to begin. The facility is targeted for completion by late 2025 or early 2026.\nUnder an initial agreement by both companies, Bumi will supply coal for the facility through its Kaltim Prima Coal (KPC) mining subsidiary and its Ithaca Resources' Kaltim Nusantara Coal subsidiary. Both companies will be responsible for the offtake of the methanol produced, while Air Products will be the builder, owner, and operator of the facility.\nIndonesia's energy ministry (ESDM) welcomed the development of the new gasification facility, saying that these types of projects will help accelerate investments in the growing downstream coal sector.\nInvestments remain low because of the significant financial undertaking needed, as well as the lack of an existing market for coal derivative products, the ESDM said.

[1]\nThe estate is publicly owned and operated. Tenants include companies in the food processing and manufacturing industries. They enjoy various tax and regulatory incentives, as well as access to transportation infrastructure.\nHistory of the Zone\nIn 1988, the Indonesian government created the Makassar Industrial Estate.[2]\nThe estate was created at a time of rapid economic growth in Indonesia. President Suharto, who governed Indonesia from 1968 until 1998, made significant reforms to the economy. Indonesia’s GDP grew from $7 billion USD in 1968 to $84 billion USD in 1988.\nIn the late 1980s, the Indonesian government passed several reforms to increase exports such as devaluing the currency. Notably, in 1989, the government created SEZ-style “Industrial Estates.” Restrictions on foreign investment within the estates were relaxed. The reforms were successful.[5] The GDP per capita of Indonesia grew 550% during the 1990s, and annual GDP growth averaged at 7%.[6]\nPlans for the Makassar Industrial Estate go as far back as 1975, with the growth of the business park mostly occurring in the 1990s and early 2000s. The estate started producing cacao and flour in the early 2000s.[15]\nIn April 2019, the Makassar New Port opened several kilometers from the estate.[2] Recently there have been plans to expand zone because most of the existing plots have already been sold out.[4]\nNotable Tenants\nAs of 2020, there are 270 businesses operating within the industrial estate, 27 of which are Japanese companies.[2] The tenants belong to the following industries: seafood processing, cold storage, animal feed, and agricultural processing.[2]\nOne notable tenant is Indofood, one of Indonesia’s largest food processors. Another notable tenant is Plastindo, a large plastic packaging manufacturer.\nManagement of the Zone\n‍The Makassar Industrial Estate is managed by Kawasan Industri Makassar (KIMA).\nKIMA is a state owned enterprise which manages Makassar as well as several other industrial estates on the island of Sulawesi.[1] 60% of the company is owned by the Indonesian government, the Government of South Sulawesi owns 30% of the shares, and the remaining 10% is owned by the Makassar city government.[2] It is regulated by the Indonesian Ministry of State Owned Enterprises.[1]\nMain Incentives\n‍The laws that currently govern the Makassar Industrial estate are Law 39 from 2009 and Government Regulation 40 from 2021.[2][7][8][9]\nCompanies located in the zone can take advantage of the following incentives:\nThe ability to write off various investments from the corporate income tax\nAccelerated depreciation and amortization of assets\nA 10% tax on dividends\nStreamlined import / export regulations\nEasy access to business VISAs\n0% interest rates on loans for land purchases\nThe minimum wage for tenants has been reduced from 4.4 million IDR / month ($305) to 2.9 million IDR ($200)\nKIMA (the management company) will handle environmental impact assessments\n‍Infrastructure\n‍As of early 2020, the zone covers an area of 336 hectares, although there are plans for expansion.[2] The estate provides electricity, clean water, telecommunications, medical clinics, warehouses, and has a fire station. The estate also helps its tenants with construction by providing transportation or rental of equipment. The park is also the only industrial area in Sulawesi that has a liquid waste treatment process.[10]‍\nAs for location, the zone is 5 km away from the Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, 18 km away from the Soekarno Hatta Seaport, 7.6 km away from the train station, and 1.8 km away from the main road.[2]\nCorporate Social Responsibilities\n‍The Makassar Industrial Estate’s management company, KIMA, has created various corporate social responsibility programs.[12] These include:\n-KIMA Green, a program that seeks to reduce air pollution by planting trees and reducing tenant emissions\n-Financing for local entrepreneurs\n-An Educational Assistance Program\n-​​A Free Rice ATM which gives ATM cards to the community that can be used to withdraw 5 liters of free rice every 2 weeks\nEffects of COVID-19\nFor the few months of the pandemic, the estate had difficulties importing raw materials for processing. The breakdown of the global supply chain caused many tenants to be starved for inputs.[14] Consequently, KIMA suffered financially. The park’s financial performance in 2020 dropped compared to their performanced in 2018. Net profit in 2020 had shrunk by 10% compared to the previous year.[13]\nPlanned Expansion\n‍In early 2019, the Ministry of Investment announced that they would expand the zone from 336 hectares to 1000 hectares. Existing plots were almost entirely sold out, and the estate found itself unable to accommodate new investors seeking to enter. A second location, called KIMA 2, is scheduled to be built elsewhere in the city Makassar.[11] The Makassar Industrial Estate is also working to modernize its logistics systems.\nConclusion\n‍The Makassar Industrial Estate is one of Indonesia’s fastest growing SEZs, and will likely continue playing a major role in the region over the next decade.\"\n\n\n", "Latitude": -5.104643, "Longitude": 119.497902 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 119.497902, -5.104643 ] } },

In Routa District, Regent Kery facilitated the entry of PT.Sulawesi Cahaya Mineral (SCM) through the flag of PT.Indonesia Konawe Industrial Park (IKIP) which invested around IDR 58 trillion in capital. Mining activities in Routa are currently underway. PT.IKIP will explore over the mining business permit area (IUP) owned by PT.SCM, which is an area of ​​3,563 hectares. The corporation is currently building an industrial complex with various other supporting infrastructure. \nThe presence of investment in Routa is projected to absorb around six to eight thousand workers. It is believed that the absorption of so many workers will alleviate unemployment. Routa, which was previously branded as a marginal area, is now predicted to become a developed area thanks to the influx of investment in the region. \nKonawe Regent Kery Saiful Konggoasa said, through private investment in Routa, nickel factories and other derivatives will be built in that area. This includes nickel derivatives, namely lithium, which is used as a raw material for making electric vehicle batteries. \"We are grateful for the investment in Routa. We need the investment in order to accelerate regional progress. This investment will also help us overcome employment problems in Konawe,\" Regent Kery told Kendari Pos yesterday. \nMeanwhile, Konawe Secretary (Sekab) Konawe Ferdinand Sapan stated, PT.SCM has so far continued to improve the progress of the development of industrial estates in Routa.

Thus, when corporations build their industrial estates or other supporting areas related to industry, it will have a positive impact on the community. That's why, we have to prepare the RDTR from the start ,\" he explained. \nWith that support, said Ferdinand Sapan, PT.SCM will consistently prioritize all the potential that exists in Konawe to support the company's production activities. Whether it's the potential of natural resources (SDA) or human resources (HR). \nThe former Head of BPKAD Konawe admitted that on various occasions when he met delegations from PT. SCM, he always asked the corporation to prioritize local potential rather than looking elsewhere. \"One of the things I conveyed to the company, if they need to eat there and still eat from rice, never buy rice from other places. They have to buy rice from Konawe. Later, if Konawe can't afford it, then look elsewhere,\" said Ferdinand Sapa. He said, to further strengthen the commitment between the government and the private sector regarding investment in Routa, the Konawe Regency Government will also make a memorandum of understanding with PT.SCM. For example, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) related to the concept of managing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds which is the responsibility of the company. \n\"So we use methods like that. The MoU includes the education sector. Later we will try to convey that our human resources need to be pushed or increased in level.

SCM, 2,500 workers had been recruited to build the mega industrial complex in the westernmost region of Konawe. But the problem going forward, he continued, is when corporations need skilled workers (skills). Meanwhile, the readiness of Konawe's human resources with special skills is still relatively low. \"One of the things we have prepared is the later integration of the need for skilled workers from the Polytechnic in Morosi.

The AMMAN Group includes PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (PT AMNT) which operates the Batu Hijau mine and PT Amman Mineral Industri (PT AMIN) which builds and operates a smelter facility...\"\n\nVoi.id, 11/7/2022: Construction Of Amman Mineral Smelter In West Sumbawa Is Almost Capai 50 Percent, Targeted By Rampung In 2024\n\"The metal mineral processing plant (smelter) construction project developed by PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (AMMAN), until early November 2022 almost reached 50 percent.\nThe amount of funds that have been disbursed has reached 465 million dollars out of the total investment requirement estimated at US $ 982 million or equivalent to Rp. 14.7 trillion.\nHead of Corporate Communications of PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara, Kartika Octaviana said the construction of the smelter was completed in 2024 from the initial projection set by the government in June 2023.\nKartika added, the construction of a smelter in Batu Hijau, West Sumbawa Regency, West Nusa Tenggara, should have been delayed a little from the schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis creates a number of face-to-face meetings to discuss the specifications of delayed smelter engineering and engineering which will have an impact on the construction work timeline, as well as delays in the negotiation process and financial statement decision.\n\"As a result, the mobilization of large equipment and equipment that is very important for the construction of smelters, especially from Europe, has been delayed from the initial schedule,\" Kartika said as quoted by Antara, Monday, November 7.\nThis year, Kartika continued, the challenges are even greater with the Ukraine-Russia conflict affecting the delay in supply chain, in the form of increasing cost of mobilizing goods and humans, lack of containers, to closing ports.\nConsidering that almost 50 percent of investment has been disbursed, Kartika continued, it is impossible for the mineral mining company, which is affiliated with PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk, to withdraw from the smelter project.\n\"This means that we remain committed to completing the construction of the smelter, especially since the funding is also available,\" he said.\nThe Green Stone smelter project is projected to have a production capacity of 222,000 tons of copper cathode. In addition, the smelter will produce 17.8 tons of gold, 54.7 tons of silver and 830.000 sulfate acid.\nAMMAN's Head of Social Impact Priyo Pramono added that the six-month verification achievement always exceeded the target and the construction of the camp was completed in October 2022.\n\"The smelter construction and supporting facilities have also started since July 2022 with the installation of stake poles, including the installation of special water facilities, in the form of desalized water and dem generalization. The mobilization of contractors to the construction area has also been carried out,\" he said.\nPriyo added that the purchase order for the long lead equipment has been executed. Moreover, there has been a signing of an agreement to finance syndicates from banks and companies that have processed recruitment in stages according to the construction stage, in collaboration with the West Sumbawa Regency Government (KSB) and NTB.\"\n\n8/11/2022: KSB \"All Out\" Helps Realize Smelter Development\n\"The Regional Government of West Sumbawa Regency (KSB) is making every effort to help create a smelter or metal mineral smelting industry which is currently in the process of preparing for development. Moreover, in accordance with President Jokowi's directives, that all regional leaders must support the acceleration of investment in their respective regions.\nKSB Regent Dr. HW Musyafirin said that the smelter in this area will later trigger a derivative industry that can move the economy even faster. So that in this preparation process, the KSB Regional Government together with the NTB Provincial Government and PT. Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (AMNT) actively communicates with the central government so that all processes run smoothly.\nHe said the location for the smelter construction was in Otak Keris Hamlet, Maluk District, KSB. Maluk District itself has been designated by the central government as a priority industrial area along with 26 other priority industrial areas in Indonesia.\n\"The Maluk District has been decided to become an industrial area out of 27 priority industrial areas to be built in Indonesia and it is included in the national medium-term development plan for 2020-2024,\" said HW Musyafirin in a special interview with Suara NTB recently.\nIn order to create an industrial area, including for the construction of a smelter, the Regional Government of KSB has the principle that there should be no obstacles, especially those that come from the government. The government must go all out to provide support.\n''So from the start we were with the Regional Leadership Communication Forum, where there were the Chair of the PN, the Chair of the DPRD, the Kajari, the Head of the Police and the Dandim all out to help,'' said the Regent.\nHe said, PT. AMNT has written a letter to KSB containing a request for facilitation of land acquisition in Otak Keris Hamlet, which incidentally is a village area. Initially the Regional Government of KSB hoped that the Smelter could be built in the coastal area, especially where PT. AMNT already owns around 200 hectares of land.\n''However, technically the location did not meet the requirements, so during the trip the Otak Keris area was chosen, even though this is a village area,'' he said.\nOtak Keris is included in the plan to establish an industrial area with an area of ​​1,164 hectares. Because it will be used as an industrial zone, land in hamlets with around 60 families is included in the land acquisition priority.\n''What was needed at that time was 150 hectares, plus another 20 hectares. So more or less what we have freed is around 170 hectares, and it's all clear . Until the last, around 61 hectares, the settlement was through the courts. It's already inrah, the decision from the Supreme Court has also been passed,''explained the Regent.\nMusyafirin admitted that he is very optimistic that this smelter will definitely be realized, especially since his party has moved very far to realize this project. It's just that the Covid-19 pandemic has hampered this program a bit, but in principle this smelter will still be built according to plan.\nCurrently, in preparation for the construction of a smelter, camps or workers' camps are being built with a total of around 2000 – 3000 camps. An engaged workforce with prioritizing local labour. Even now, the Integrated Team tasked with recruiting workers is currently selecting around 1,200 workers for smelter preparation.\n Regarding the proportion of local workers in the construction of this smelter, the Regional Government of KSB certainly prioritizes local workers and local resources for company needs. Likewise other resources such as building materials and food needs so that PT. AMNT absorbs the maximum from the local community.\n“In every meeting with AMNT, we always convey that local resources must be a priority. Local resources such as materials, sand, crushed stone, as well as local materials such as rice, vegetables and others. Including labor resources, it must be prioritized from KSB,\" he said.\nThe KSB Regent admitted that he had drafted a regional regulation so that it was the responsibility of the company, and all sub-contractors working in KSB to use local human resources of at least 40 percent. Prior to drafting this Perda, a Perbup first appeared which required companies to absorb local workers and other local resources with a minimum amount of 60 percent.\n“However, we will make a regional regulation for a minimum of 40 percent of resources. Moreover, the central government has asked that spending on local products be at least 40 percent in the regional budget. We try to comply with regulations,\" he explained.\nThe Regional Government of KSB has conducted a comparative study in Gresik, East Java to take a close look at the smelter industry there and its derivative industries. The Department of Manpower has been given orders to train local workers to become skilled by inviting the involvement of PT. AMNT.

From the results of the survey, 4 aspects were obtained which had sufficient evidence, namely; licensing/non-licensing aspects, project preparation aspects, spatial planning aspects and land provision aspects. While the other 9 aspects, namely funding, government guarantees, procurement of goods/services, project development implementation, prioritizing domestic components, supervision and control, project regulations, work creation aspects and aspects of utilization do not yet have strong evidence or supporting data.\nIt is hoped that the BPKP will be able to obtain updated information from the NTB Provincial Government, West Sumbawa Regency Government and PT. Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (PT. AMNT) so that BPKP can carry out a comprehensive and integrated cross-sector supervisory role in overseeing the Development of Industrial Estates in West Sumbawa Regency which can ultimately fulfill development accountability in achieving the RPJMN project targets, the NTB Provincial RPJMD and the President's priority programs.\nThe current issues of smelter development discussed include:\nThe issue of land acquisition, where in the 154 hectares of land for smelter construction there is still land that has not been acquired;\nChanges to the construction schedule and completion of the smelter construction which was originally planned to be completed in 2022 to 2023;\nChange in production capacity from 1.3 MTPA to 0.9 MTPA;\nThe progress of the smelter development has not been significant.\nIn response to this problem, the NTB Provincial BAPPEDA represented by the Young Expert Planning Functional (B. Sri Ratna Setiawati, ST, M.Eng.) said that the Industrial Area of ​​West Sumbawa Regency had been listed in the Revised RTRW of NTB Province as a Provincial Strategic Area from the point of view of growth interests economy. In addition, in the Spatial Pattern Plan, both the Revised RTRW for the Province of NTB and the Regional Regulation on the RTRW for West Sumbawa Regency, it is stated that the area of ​​the West Sumbawa Regency Industrial Area is 1,160 Ha, which is divided into several zones, as follows:\nThe smelter zone and its derivative industries cover an area of ​​850 Ha which has received recommendations for suitability for spatial use from the NTB Provincial Spatial Planning Coordination Team (TKPRD) in 2018. From an area of ​​850 Ha it is divided into smelter zones covering 154 Ha (100% land acquisition has been carried out by PT . AMNT) and smelter-derived industrial zones covering an area of ​​696 Ha (not entirely cleared);\nSmall and medium industrial zone (IKM) covering an area of ​​310 Ha.\nIn this case, the NTB Province BAPPEDA has always been cooperative and is willing to provide the data needed by the BPKP regarding the smelter construction plan. The Team for the Acceleration of Smelter Development and Its Derivative Industries, which consists of relevant stakeholders , both from the NTB Provincial Government and the West Sumbawa Regency Government, which has worked based on the NTB Governor's Decree since 2018, has carried out its duties to the fullest at the planning stage. For the implementation phase, there has been a change in the schedule for the completion of the smelter construction, which was originally planned to be completed in 2022, to be postponed to 2023. PT. AMNT explained that this was due to the Covid 19 pandemic, so that the progress of the smelter construction has not yet been significant. Regarding the decrease in production capacity of 1.3 MTPA (million tonnes per annual / million tonnes per year) to 0.9 MTPA, the Head of the ESDM Service explained that this was the authority of the central government.\nClosing the event, the Secretary of West Nusa Tenggara Province said that the NTB Provincial Government and West Sumbawa Regency Government must continue to oversee and immediately take care of accelerating the clarity of the status of Industrial Estates in West Sumbawa Regency, West Nusa Tenggara Province and it is hoped that clarity on the status of this industrial area will be obtained before the construction of a smelter and its derivative industries held.\"\n\nLombokpost.jawapos.com, 6/9/2021: Congratulations, West Sumbawa Enters the 2020-2024 National RPJM Industrial Area\n\"TALIWANG-West Sumbawa Regency (KSB) is designated as an industrial area and is included in the 2020-2024 medium-term development plan (RPJMN).\n“The smelter is only a small part.

One of the facilities provided and of concern is the power supply of electricity from power plants in the JIIPE Gresik Industrial Estate.\n\nThe existence of a power plant in the JIIPE Industrial Zone will certainly provide a guarantee of high supply and reliability, always sufficient, and reliable, so that it will be the main attraction for industrial companies. Based on data from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and the Ministry of Industry in 2019 that of the 92 Industrial Estates at present, only around 13 Industrial Estates have their own power plants. One of them that is really of good capacity is the JIIPE Gresik Industrial Estate which has an Electricity Supply Business Area.\n\nAnd if you pay attention, this Industrial Estate which has its own Power Plant like JIIPE has its own advantages compared to other Industrial Estates where electricity is supplied by PLN. One of them is the availability of electricity supply in JIIPE Industrial Estate and the stability of the voltage is more guaranteed and it will not even flicker (even a fraction of a second).\n\nUntil now, it can be said that the reliability of electricity provided by the JIIPEdi Gresik Industrial Estate power plant is very good so that this can be an attraction for private investors engaged in the industry which at all times are highly dependent on the existence of electricity such as steel processing plants, smelters and others.\"\n\n", "Captive Coal Power Plant": null, "Captive Gas Power Plant": 1.0, "On-grid": null, "Electricity Capacity Notes": "23 MW (Phase 1: Fully developed and available)\nElectricty 250 MW - ready in 2023", "Electricity Capacity (MW)": 23.0, "Planned Electricity Capacity": null, "Latitude": -7.086298, "Longitude": 112.607293 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 112.607293, -7.086298 ] } },

The disposal of factory liquid waste at Hyundai is not in accordance with regulations.\n\"Hyundai admits its guilt,\" said Head of the Civil and Administrative Section of the Cikarang District Attorney Rolando Ritonga recently.\nRolando said, Hyundai did not extend the liquid waste disposal permit (IPL C). Hyundai's industrial waste has also exceeded the quality standard threshold.\n\"Results of a study by the Ministry of Environment, the Cikadu river, which flows into the CBL river to the sea, is experiencing extraordinary pollution due to Hyundai's waste disposal,\" said Rolando.\nThe lawsuit was then settled for Rp. 2 billion\nOn June 6, 2014, the Bekasi Regency Government sued PT Hyundai Inti Development in a civil lawsuit with a compensation value of IDR 16 billion.\nPT Hyundai Inti Development is the manager of the Hyundai industrial area and is responsible for permitting the disposal of liquid waste from local factories.\nThe value of IDR 16 billion is determined based on calculations from the Ministry of Environment experts. \"Compensation is calculated from 2010 to February 2014,\" said Rolando.\nInitially, the government and Hyundai negotiated out of court. Hyundai stated that it was only able to pay compensation of 147 million. The government refused.\nHyundai then increased its offer to Rp 200 million, but the government still refused. Finally, Hyundai agreed to Rp 400 million. The government still refuses.\n“Finally brought to court. The government and Hyundai agreed on a figure of Rp 2 billion. It must be paid no later than November 2015. The money goes to the regional administration,\" said Rolando.\nIn addition to paying Rp 2 billion, Hyundai is required to repair the sewage system so there will be no more pollution. Within 8 months, the canal repair should be completed.\n\"If it doesn't complete the repairs within the allotted time, Hyundai will have to pay Rp 5 billion. That's the deal,\" he said.\nPT Hyundai Inti Development's lawyer, Army Mulyanto, explained that his client had paid Rp. 1 billion to the West Java Bank (BJB) account belonging to the Bekasi Regency Government.\n\"Hyundai has paid Rp. 1 billion in early October. The drawback, another Rp. 1 billion, is paid no later than 30 days after the first payment,\" said Army.\nAccording to the Army, Hyundai is also working on repairing the sewage channel that will flow into the Cikadu River as agreed with the government.\n“Hyundai will fulfill all the agreements. As for channel repairs, Hyundai is currently repairing them,\" said Army.\nJust to note, the Hyundai Bekasi industrial area was built by PT Hyundai Inti Development on an area of ​​200 hectares in Bekasi Regency and was operational in 1991.\nPT Hyundai Inti Development is a joint venture between Hyundai Corporation (South Korea) and PT. Lippo Cikarang Tbk.\nPT Lippo Cikarang Tbk (Lippo Group) itself is a company that owns and manages a number of industrial estates in Bekasi Regency. These include the EJIP industrial area, Delta Silicon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. This includes Hyundai.\nCurrently, Lippo Cikarang is also developing an area called Delta Silicon 8 on an area of ​​250 hectares.

The resolution of the land allocation issue is unclear.  In 2016, Tatang Sofyan, the Head of the Land Agency of Sukabumi Regency and Rudolf Imam Santoso, among others, were designated suspects by the Cibadak State Prosecutor's Office in a corruption case over potential bribery in the transfer of state HGU land from PT Tenjojaya in Tenjoyaya Village to PT Bogorindo Cemergland.\n\nBased on an article by Seputar Jagat MP (2021), it appears that the land, which was formerly owned by PT. Tenjojaya, should have been returned to the state and accessible to over 100 local village cultivators (who have worked on the land since the 1970s) when PT. Tenjojaya's HGU expired. Instead, the HGU was transferred to Rudolf Imam Santoso, the head of PT Bogorindo. In 2021, it was reported that the land that had been transfered to PT. Bogorindo included structures built by Tenjojaya residents, such as the village office and schools, and that the community requested compensation and information on the ownership status of the land. \n\nOn June 26, 2022, it was reported by Mata Investigasi that Patty Nurchalis disclosed that PT. Bogorindo Cemerland was obtained through corruption, based on numerous court decisions inpreceding years, and that the 299 hectares had been confiscated by the West Java High Prosecutor's Office since 2016. Additionally, in a letter to an Ombudsman at the West Java High Prosecutor's Office, \"Nurchalis emphasized that the Prosecutor's Commission issued a recommendation for the PT.

Rita Susilawati, Head of the Center for Groundwater and Environmental Geology (PATGTL) at the Geological Agency, said that the lowering of the groundwater level, which is in a delicate condition, is due to excessive water withdrawal.  Rita revealed, based on the Groundwater Conservation Map of the Bandung–Soreang Groundwater Basin (CAT) compiled by the Geological Agency in 2010, in the Cileunyi area and its surroundings there has been a decrease in the pressured groundwater level (deep groundwater or artesian) to around 60 meters below the ground surface. local.\nSo that the area, he continued, is a vulnerable area with a reduction rate of 40 percent to 60 percent from the initial condition. \"This phenomenon was seen in several places, including around the Cileunyi area to the Rancaekek area and its surroundings,\" he said via text message, Monday (6/2/2023). According to him, the Rancaekek area and its surroundings have a confined aquifer system (deep aquifer or artesian) at a depth of around 50 to 150 meters.\nThis area is hydrogeologically an area of ​​groundwater discharge from the Bandung–Soreang CAT. \"The pattern of depressed groundwater flow (deep groundwater) in the plains of Rancaekek and its surroundings indicates a conical phenomenon of lowering the groundwater level which indicates very intensive groundwater extraction,\" he said. In fact, he continued, the Rancaekek area has experienced a decrease in the depressed groundwater level (deep/artesian groundwater) to more than 70 meters below the local ground level. This causes the area to be an area prone to damage with a reduction rate of 40 percent to more than 80 percent from the initial condition. His party said that after 2010, the Geology Agency did not carry out monitoring of groundwater conditions in the Cileunyi and Rancaekek areas which were included in the Bandung-Soreang CAT. That authority, continued Rita, belongs to the government of West Java Province. \"Currently the authority to manage groundwater has changed to being based on river areas, and the Bandung area, which is included in the Citarum River area, becomes central authority, so that in 2023 the Geological Agency will again carry out groundwater monitoring activities in Bandung and its surroundings,\" he added. Water Conditions Rita added, the cause of the damaged groundwater conditions along Cileunyi to Rancaekek was due to excessive groundwater extraction in the area. Considering that there are many industrial buildings in the Rancaekek area , this does not rule out being the cause. However, continued Rita, it is necessary to further evaluate whether the industry is the cause of the decrease in the groundwater level in Cileunyi to Rancaekek. \"To find out whether the industry is the main cause, further evaluation is needed, because if the industry complies with the groundwater withdrawal regulations set forth in the permit, it should not cause problems,\" he said. His party highlighted the rampant illegal and unlicensed groundwater extraction. \"What must be paid attention to is illegal or unlicensed groundwater extraction which is still rife. Unlicensed drilled wells cannot control the discharge of groundwater pumping, so it has the potential to cause damage to groundwater conditions in an area,\" he concluded." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 107.799664, -6.962019 ] } },

Muhara, Sunday (22/5/2022).\nSopian, the owner of the rice field, who is also a local resident, said that the water overflowed and inundated his parents' rice field as a result of the PT Irama Gemilang Lestari (IGL) industrial area construction project, resulting in landslides and narrowing of the Muhara river.\nOther rice field owners, Arumi and Budin, also felt the same thing. They admitted that they had been so badly affected that they were no longer able to grow crops due to flooding or overflowing waters of the Muhara River.\n\"The Muhara River, which used to be approximately 8 meters wide, has now shrunk to approximately 2 meters and due to heavy rain, the land around the industrial area collapsed and covered the river basin (DAS) so that the river water rose and flooded my parents' rice fields,\" complained Sopian. .\nSopian said that at the beginning of the construction of the industrial area, he had said that the river should be tidied up first, so that the residents' rice fields would not be flooded, but the developer ignored this.\n\"We hope that the government will be sensitive, because currently residents still need agricultural land as a source of income for residents,\" he explained.\nMeanwhile, Dudung, a youth leader from Cileles Village, claimed that the local government was not sensitive to the effects or impacts of the IGL industrial area project.

In a public hearing on Wednesday (15/3/2023), residents revealed that there was a practice of brokering in the land acquisition process so that they suffered losses.\nSayuti, one of the residents, said that as a result of this practice, he only received IDR 100 million in December 2020, for the down payment for the acquisition of his approximately 5,000 square meter land from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa through Rusli, a broker. This value is far from the initially agreed price, namely IDR 1.49 billion.\n\"Even though I have never given any power of attorney to Rusli. \"That's why I keep asking what happens to the remaining payments,\" he said.\nIt was explained that after investigating it, it was later discovered that the management of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa had paid off its obligations through Rusli's savings account, but unfortunately the amount was not as expected, namely only IDR 1.1 billion, which was suddenly rejected by Sayuti.\n“Yes, of course we don't want to. Moreover, there is already an agreement that if the completion process is later than 2020, the price will be adjusted, even though we are not discussing this issue. \"We only demand rights,\" he said.\nRusli was also present at the hearing. In his statement, he said that the emergence of the problem was triggered by pressure on repayment by Sayuti and the payment pattern which was paid in installments and bailed out by individual employees of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa with certain considerations so that the value did not match what Sayuti expected.\n“After continuing to pay in installments for two years, finally I was confused. Because the family didn't want to accept it, they didn't want to return it to Pancapuri, so in the end the money was returned to me. \"Later, if the price is right, then I will give it to my family, this was my mistake at that time,\" said Rusli.\nFrom this brokering practice, Rusli explained that he received a wage of IDR 5 thousand per meter from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa. Furthermore, he even admitted the truth regarding him not holding a power of attorney from Sayuti. This was because his role as a broker for around 50 other land owners had long been known to many residents, long before he had any dealings with Sayuti.\n“Essentially, I admit that I was wrong, and I fully understand the implications of the actions I have committed. In fact, from the start I told the family, if you want to report it to the police, you can. \"If it were me, I wouldn't be running anywhere, in fact it would be clear to see who is playing at Pancapuri,\" he explained.\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of Commission I of the Cilegon DPRD, Masduki, hopes that this issue will reveal the dark veil of the polemic about land acquisition for residents by PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa which has not yet been resolved.\n\"What's even more strange is why Pancapuri can go to him (transact with Rusli), even though he doesn't have a power of attorney. But this is one of the cases, it could be that the previous problem also had a model like this. Well, everything will be revealed as to who the land mafia is, including the 50 residents (facilitated by brokers) who actually need to be investigated, but that's not in our area. It's possible that the polemic that arose at Mount Sugih was because of casuistry like this. \"From Pancapuri, it was completed but not delivered,\" said Masduki.\nUnfortunately, the hearing which was attended by the Regional Financial and Asset Management Agency (BPKAD), the Head of the Legal Section of the Regional Secretariat of Cilegon City, the National Land Agency (BPN) of Cilegon City, Subdistricts and Districts was not also attended by the management of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa.\n\"Even if Pancapuri cannot attend today without news and confirmation, we will invite him back later, and I will coordinate with the leadership,\" explained this PAN politician.\n\n(BantenNews, 9/22/2022, bantennews.co.id): PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa Regrets Blocking Project Access by Cilodan Residents\n\"Dozens of residents of the Cilodan Neighborhood RT 18/05 Gunung Sugih Village, Ciwandan District, Cilegon City on Thursday (22/9/2022) blocked an environmental road which has been the access for PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa's heavy vehicle mobility for the development project of PT Chandra Asri Petrochemical ( CAP) 2.\nThe residents had to carry out the action of blocking the road and unfurling a banner containing the demands because it was confirmed that PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa had not completed its obligation to acquire the land belonging to the residents.\n\"The road has been used by Pancapuri for the road project, while my extended family, around 20 of the houses above, have not been released, that doesn't include the families below. We are disturbed by the dust from the project,\" said Dani Adhani (63), a resident to BantenNews.co.id.\nAccording to Dani, his decision was unanimous regarding the acquisition value of approximately 3,000 square meters of land belonging to his family. However, the value offered has not yet received a response from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa.\n“Those who come to us are all brokers, not A1, whose Pancapuri people are. If you are a broker, you know yourself. Meanwhile, if my family has clearly asked for the figure of Rp. 5 million per meter, and that's okay, it doesn't count as house buildings. That's why we are blocking it, so it's better to just close it first,\" he explained.\nAccording to Dani Adhani, the majority of local residents have left their homes after receiving payment for their release from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa. \"All that's left here is my family, along with Haji Ismat's family, Sayani, the others have all been released,\" he said.\nUntil this news was released, the Director of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa, Abraham Sinatrawan, confirmed via his cellphone that he had not responded to calls and WhatsApp messages sent by journalists.\"\n" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 106.0253571, -5.995740374 ] } },

Not only the community around the company, such as Sungai Awan Kanan Village, but the community outside the company environment.“The smell of this sewage can reach Payak Kumang and Sukaharja villages. A radius of 2-3 kilometers still smells of the waste,\" he explained.Ratam assessed that the waste caused an odor because it was not managed properly by the company. Maybe the company just doesn't understand. However, said Ratam, it could also be intentional and does not care about the environment.\n“Besides the stench, the information we heard was that there were dead community plants around the waste disposal site.

Residents admitted that they had submitted several demands to the management of PT JZD and the owner of the PT KIP Group area, to temporarily close PT JZD's operations. Apart from that, the residents asked the company to take responsibility for eliminating the stench. This is in the interest of the community,\" he said. Ratam revealed, PT JZD only employs a dozen people. Because, more work using machines. \"So don't make excuses about the workforce,\" he said.\nSanctions for Closing Operations Staff of the Planning and Environmental Impact Study Section of the Ketapang Regency People's Housing, Settlement Areas and Environment (Perkim-LH) Office, Yuan Again, said that his agency had already inspected PT JZD's waste disposal site. Sanctions for closing the company's operations in the PT KIP Group area, Muara Pawan District may be imposed. \"Crucially, the waste in the tapioca industry is stored in the ponds that were made, but the processing is still manual and does not meet the waste treatment specifications,\" he stressed. Yuan continued, the company's waste creates an unpleasant odor that spreads to residential areas. Even up to a fairly far radius. As a result of checking the field, the Perkim-LH Service will submit a letter of recommendation to the management of PT JZD, including PT KIP as the owner of the area so that the waste does not flow into the pond, until the company can manage the waste properly. Our recommendation, no more waste disposal in the pool. Even the waste that has already been dumped in several ponds, we ask them to cover it with tarpaulins and take care of it, so that the smell doesn't spread,\" he explained. Yuan added, a letter of recommendation would be sent by his side this week to the company, and asked the company to follow this recommendation. \"They are obliged to do so. follow our recommendations. If they are not heeded and waste is still flowing, then the sanction may be closed completely,\" he said.

BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA and PT. KETAPANG BANGUN PRIMA which are companies incorporated in HANGZHOU JINJIANG GROUP CO., LTD which is based in the city of Lin'an, Zhejiang province, China.\nIn this project, HANGZHOU JINJIANG GROUP CO., LTD in the initial stage invested funds amounting to 1,250 million USD which was intended for the construction of an industrial area, an aluminum factory with a capacity of 4.5 million tons per year, the construction of a 15 x 25 MW PLTU and the construction of a special port.\nIt is planned that the aluminum industry which is managed by the company PT. BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA, whose raw material is bouxite, will be supplied by 9 companies including Pt. Tamindo Mutiara Perkasa, Pt. Fortuna Jaya Makmur, Pt. Kindai Mandiri Sejahtera 290, Pt.

Meliau Ratu Abadi with a total production plan of 10 million tons per year.\nThe construction that is currently being carried out is still at the land preparation stage, including land clearing work as well as filling and other initial construction work, but what is very unfortunate is that the supply of materials used for filling work is suspected to have been supplied from unofficial or illegal excavation sites.

Government Regulation (PP) Number 23 of 2010 concerning the Implementation of Mineral and Coal Mining Business Activities, along with Law Number 28 of 2009 concerning Taxes and Levies and what is no less important is the existence of an environmental permit from the Kendawangan district government or the West Kalimantan Regency Government, however \"None of these things are owned by the excavation manager,\" he said irritably.\nMonitoring in the field of excavation activities using excavator type heavy equipment and transported by dozens of dump truck type vehicles going back and forth to the landfill site via public roads which created dust and no watering activities were carried out by the management of excavation C. According to several residents, the excavation was coordinated by someone named Mr. Deril alias Maxklem alias Mc lean D. Meray is suspected of being a thug and is the third hand in collecting PT.

This action sparked a reaction of resistance from opposing labor groups. As a result, clashes were inevitable.\nHundreds of police officers intervened to mediate between the two warring camps.\nThe workers' strike action was to urge the management of PT VDNI and PT OSS to provide family allowances, transportation allowances and housing allowances to workers. The workers also asked the company to carry out Collective Labor Agreement (PKB) negotiation procedures in accordance with Minister of Manpower Regulation (Permenaker) No. 28 of 2014, and urged the central management leadership to remove the HRD position of PT. OSS and PT. VDNI in Morosi.\nFor your information, these two nickel refining companies, PT VDNI and PT OSS, are located in the Morosi industrial area. PT VDNI was founded in 2014 and is a subsidiary of De Long Nickel Co Ltd which originates from Jiangsu, China. This company invested tens of trillions of rupiah to build a smelter facility with modern technology. Its production capacity is 600,000-800,000 tons of nickel pig iron per year. Until the end of 2018, PT VDNI had contributed US$142.2 million to Indonesian exports.\nThe parent companies of PT OSS are Hong Kong Xiangyu Hansheng Co Ltd and Singapore Xiangyu Hansheng Pte Ltd. This company was founded in 2016 in an area of ​​398 hectares with an investment value of US$ 2 billion. Since 2018, this company has applied for a principle permit to build a 400,000 ton stainless steel production facility, 800,000 ton steel lab and 800,000 ton ferronickel. To date, PT OSS has built 17 smelter furnaces out of the planned 30 furnaces.\nMeanwhile, Arys Nirwana, Head of Human Resources Department PT VDNI and PT OSS, in his release explained that what was conveyed by the action participants did not match the facts. This is because, for example, the company has good intentions and is open to discussing this matter as long as the labor union fulfills the requirements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\nIn every meeting held at the company, at the Konawe Regency Manpower Office and the Provincial DPRD Hearing Meeting, the company complied with the summons and acted cooperatively.\nFor wage demands, the company's payroll system refers to statutory regulations and company regulations/policies.

When Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry built the smelter there eight years ago, people from around Morosi went there hoping to make money. Economic opportunities grew when Obsidian Stainless Steel officially opened a nickel smelter last year. The two companies are subsidiaries of Xiangyu and the Delong Group, a Chinese business alliance. Obsidian has a production capacity of over 2.5 million tons of nickel per year. Virtue Dragon has a production capacity of over 1 million tons annually. Those two factories produce nickel pig iron (NPI), ferronickel, and nickel matte. Those three nickel ore products are components for making steel. As of the third quarter of 2021, Obsidian exported over 800,000 tons of NPI worth Rp24.5 trillion. Virtue Dragon exported 618,117 metric tons worth Rp17 trillion over that same period. In addition to stimulating the economy outside the factory gates, those two large smelters provide a lot of jobs. La Ode Muhammad Alihaswandy, Chief of the Office of Transmigration and Labor of Southeast Sulawesi, said that out of 25,281 workers at those two smelters, 1,893 are from China. “The mining sector accounts for 2.9 percent of workers,” he said. According to Alihaswandy, the opening of shops is but one domino effect from the construction of nickel smelters in Morosi. Residents rent out boarding rooms or houses, open restaurants, workshops, and other commercial facilities. Newly built shops sprouted up along the road in Morosi... The growth in economy in Southeast Sulawesi due to this nickel mining activity has created a new problem: trash accumulation. In addition to the high amount of street dust and smoke resulting from the burning of coal to power the ore processing plant, trash scatters on the streets around the market or vendor shops, and is even found in the river and swamps. It appears that the local government has not made any plans in response to the impact of this sudden economic change. While most of the vendors come from outside of Morosi, locals tend to become factory workers or work side jobs in addition to their company jobs. Residents of Mandiodo, Tapuemea, and Tapunggaya villages no longer work as fishermen. They have gone to work in the factories or have taken up nickel mining. According to Ratna Kasim, head of neighborhood unit (RT) 4 in Tapunggaya village, of the 32 heads of households in her area only two still remain as fishermen. Her husband is paid Rp3 million a month as a security guard for heavy machinery located at the mining location. “Everything has grown with nickel,” she said, pointing to the houses with cars in the garages. Before the nickel mining, houses in her neighborhood had wood walls and sago palm frond roofing. Nearly no one can endure to work as fisherman in the villages located around the nickel mining location. Ratna said that the waters are contaminated with nickel slurry. Fishing platforms are often destroyed when barges in Tapunggaya Bay crash into them. As a result, fishers must search for daily catch further out at sea, making it more expensive to sail. “It is difficult to find fish now,” she said. Amirudin is one of two heads of households in RT 4 in Tapunggaya who remains to be a fisherman. He confirmed Ratna’s story. According to him, fish catches have been getting smaller since nickel mining started. Sometimes he catches 10 kilograms of fish a night, which are sold in the market for Rp200,000. “Before the nickel mining, my income was Rp600,000 a night,” he said. This is also the case in Mandiodo village. Slamet Riadi, the local village head, said that of the 239 heads of households in his area, perhaps only about 10 percent are still fishermen. Slamet explained that in addition to having difficulty catching fish, working in the factory is more promising. “It used to be easy to catch fish and difficult to sell them. Now it is easy to sell them but you have to go far out to catch them,” he said. In addition to earning wages working at the nickel smelter, residents in villages receive compensation from each company for the dust issue. In Mandiodo village, said Slamet, each family receives Rp1.5 million in compensation per month. This was an agreement reached between local communities and the company. According to him, the air became polluted after the nickel smelter went into operation, and conditions are particularly bad during the dry season. However, during the rainy season the dust dissipates but Mandiodo is inundated by mud, something which had never previously occurred in this village. In early December 2022, the entire Mandiodo village was inundated with mud mid-calf deep. According to Slamet, the mud ran down from the hills around Mandiodo that have become barren due to nickel mining. “Nickel gives life to the economy, but it destroys the environment,” he said.\"\n\nEnvironmental Justice Atlas, 4/10/2022: \"Residents that live close to Delong Nickel Smelter began to complain about the pollution from coal dust after the coal-fired power plants began operation [7].

In 2019, there was a massive flood that hit the Bahodopi area. In September 2019, hundreds of residents took to the streets in Dampala Village in the Bahodopip district, about 7 kilometers away from the IMIP, as a result of the lack of satisfying response from mining companies after the flood that hit the three villages of Dampala, Le Le and Siumbatu on 8 June 2019 [28]. The flood disaster claimed the lives of two residents and hundreds of houses, as well as public facilities. Residents that are members of the Aliansi Rakyat Menggugat (Armet) claimed that the cause of the flood was related to the nickel mining activities upstream of the village, and demanded a review of the environmental impact assessment (Amdal) document of PT Bintang Delapan Mineral (BDM) and revoking the company of its mining business license (MBL) [21]. It was reported that the flood did not affect the operation of the IMIP, but cut off some workers from their workplace due to the collapse of bridges and road. The Morowali Police Chief ended up coordinating the negotiation between the protesters and the local government, who promised to compensate the local residents for their loss and evaluate the MBL holders such as BDM [18], [28]. In November and December 2021, demonstrations were held by student group Aliansi Mahasiswa dan Masyarakat Morowali (AMMM) and consumer group Aliansi Pelanggan Listrik Menggugat (Pelita) Morowali respectively to request for solving the local electricity crisis, as local residents suffered from frequent blackouts.[29] While the demonstration was more targeting the local government and electricity provider PLN, the electricity shortage at the local communities is in direct contrast with the scale of coal-fired power plants built by the IMIP that provides electricity supply to its industrial operations. In fact, the IMIP allocated most of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) budget to electricity subsidies to address the community electricity shortage in the Bahodopi district, including Fatufia, Keurea, Bahodopi and Bahomakmur villages [30]. It was reported that the construction of the CFPP at the IMIP helped with the electricity access in the area, especially with the subsidies from the company. However, PLN did not continue the collaboration with the IMIP and used diesel power instead [31].\"\n\nEnvironmental Concerns:\nDeforestation, water pollution, damage to local farms, respiratory infections\nEnvironmental Justice Atlas, 7/5/2022: \"The Bahodopi district is home to 12 villages, including 4 villages most directly affected by the IMIP, namely Bahodopi, Keurea, Fatufia and Bahomakmur [9].

An academic article also documented different forms of conflicts involving various stakeholders in the nickel mining area in and around the IMIP based on interviews and questionnaires, especially the conflicts between migrant communities and local residents, and between local residents and companies [9]. The often mentioned impacts include the degradation of forests, rivers and coastal zones in the neighborhood, the impact on local farmers’ livelihood, and the health impact on the local residents [18]. It was reported that acute respiratory infection (ARI) is a common issue for local residents, including kids, in the Bahodopi district [18], [21].

The types of activities in question are beach reclamation, barge loading and unloading activities, giant mast erection activities, land acquisition, and smelter activities.\nAccording to residents of Tanauge, the reclamation of the coast will turn the coast and waters into artificial land. PT Stardust has reclaimed the beach for the construction of a 15 hectare jetty. And it is expected to increase again. For jetty construction activities where they are reclaiming the beach it will be used for loading and unloading ships to dock.\nMeanwhile, several barges and the like have been seen crossing the waters around the administrative area of ​​Tanauge Village. According to the Head of Tanauge Village, Abdillah, the distance from Stardust's Jetty to Tanauge Village is 2 km. Likewise with the piles that are in the waters causing fishermen to go to sea because of the presence of these piles.\nOf all the activities in the coastal and water areas by Stardust, it has narrowed the fishing area for fishermen and has damaged fisherman's FADs.\nRegarding the issue of land acquisition, the company that manages the Nickel Industrial Estate, Stardust Estate Investment, does not provide disclosure of land acquisition data to the people of Tanauge. The village government and the people who staged the demonstration asked for all data on claims for land acquisition by Stardust, however, through Public Relations who met the demonstrating communities, they said that the company had paid compensation and would not do it again. While there are still people who have not received compensation.\nThis is the current problem in Tanauge Village regarding land acquisition and compensation.\nFor smelter factories, residents of Tanauge asked for a suspension. This is because it is feared that smelter smoke entering the Tanauge Village area will cause air pollution and can affect the health of residents. The community asked the smelter manager, namely Gunbuster, to provide and open permit documents for factory management that comply with environmental requirements.\"\n\nLand acquisition issues:\nhttps://projectmultatuli.org/, 05/07/2023: \"...Wahono has rice fields and oil palm plantations.

Pollution from captive coal plants.\n\nbenua.id, 9/2/2023: \"...the PT Stardust Estate Investment (SEI) industrial area in North Morowali, Central Sulawesi. In this industrial area there is PT Gunbuster Nickel Industri (GNI) with an area of ​​1,907 hectares and PT Central Omega Resources (COR). Both are nickel refining smelter companies owned by Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry Co.Ltd, investors from China which operate in Bunta Village, East Petasia District, North Morowali.\nTo move the smelter, GNI built a Captive Coal Steam Power Plant (PLTU) on a land area of ​​712.80 hectares. Unfortunately, the process of building and working on the PLTU dammed the Lampi River at that location without the knowledge of residents and land owners around the river. Walhi Central Sulawesi predicts that when the intensity of rain is high, the Lampi River water will definitely overflow and could submerge rice fields and residential areas of local residents.\n\"The air in hamlet 5 of Bunta Village is allegedly filled with sulfur dioxide gas (So2), which is a poisonous gas resulting from burning coal from the Captive Power Plant,\" said Sunardi Katili, Regional Executive Director of Walhi, Central Sulawesi during a press conference on Monday, June 12.\nNot only that, the construction of a jetty in Tanauge Village, Petasia District to serve as an entry point for the mobilization of coal supplies since early 2023, is alleged to have taken 65 hectares of residents' land without any compensation process. Sunardi said that the majority of the people who work as fishermen at that location are also suffering due to the operation of the Captive PLTU.\n\"The massive mobilization of coal-laden barges for the needs of the Captive PLTU at that location has had a big impact on the economic and social life of fishermen around that location. \"In fact, some people have stopped fishing because coal often spills, plus strict security by the Air and Water Police has become a frightening threat for fishermen looking for fish again,\" explained Sunardi Katili.\nCurrently, PT. GNI has built 3 Captive coal PLTU units in Tanauge Village with a capacity of 300 MW which is only approximately 500 meters from residential areas. As a result, said Sunardi, residents around the PLTU have to clean their houses every day, close doors and windows to avoid black dust from PT's burning coal. GNI.\"\n\nhttps://projectmultatuli.org/, 05/07/2023: \"SINCE PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry (GNI) operated a smelter factory, Wahono and his family complained that the heat of the sun was no longer friendly. At the same time, the surface of the land around his house in Bunta Village, North Morowali, never dries out.\nThe plants lined up in front of the stilt house looked dry and covered in dust. The PT GNI industrial area is located about 10 km from his house. Dust from the factory flies around and sticks to the plants.\nUnder the house on stilts, black-brown water pooled and wet household utensils. The stagnant water smells and makes you itchy, said Wahono, who lives with his wife and three children, the youngest 6 months old, and his in-laws.\nPT GNI needs water as a coolant for coal power plants to meet the needs of nickel processing and refining facilities ( smelters ) in the area. The company takes water from the Koro Lamoito river—residents usually call it the Lampi River—by blocking the residents' river flow. As a result, river water overflowed into residential areas and flooded roads.\nTo overcome this, Wahono raised the ground surface of the house and around the house with sand and stones. The plan is that he will build a boarding house on the land next to his house.\nWahono is a transmigrant from Ponorogo, East Java, whose parents brought him in when he was 17 years old in 1996. The New Order government provided 1 ha of land for the transmigrants to work on rice fields. In total, there were 132 families from Java who took part in the transmigration program. Wahono remembers that the army was closely monitoring the process of farmers planting rice fields.\nHowever, the Indonesian government also rolled out the red carpet for two corporations coming to North Morowali, which are slowly evicting the transmigrants' land.\nThe first company was the palm oil plantation PT Agro Nusa Abadi (ANA), a subsidiary of PT Astra Agro Lestari Group, which arrived in 2006. Thirteen years later it was PT GNI.\n\"Companies should come and bring goodness to the community,\" said Wahono.\nWhat happened was just the opposite. Companies come to steal people's land. The company also caused environmental changes, making it impossible for residents to grow crops, residents alleged.\nIn the past, Wahono rice fields used to harvest twice a year. After PT ANA arrived, this company was accused of embanking the rice field planting areas, causing flooding of rice fields and residential areas. Wahono can only harvest rice once a year during the dry season.\nThen, when PT GNI closed the river flow, the water overflowed even more. Both the dry season and the rainy season, the land is submerged. Wahono couldn't harvest at all.\nIt felt, for Wahono, like being pranked by the state. \"I also know that [investment] is between countries,\" said Wahono, referring to PT GNI. “But we are the hosts. No matter how small we are.”\n'To and fro the water'\nThe main road in Bunta Village is the route for PT GNI workers' motorized vehicles and trucks entering and exiting the company. The road is now full of holes. Every time it rains heavily, the holes are flooded. Part of the ground surface of the house on the side of the road was also submerged in water.\nIn April 2023, floods submerged Bunta Village. The water almost touched the floor of the Wahono stilt house.\nIn 2019, shortly after PT GNI built a nickel smelter area, flooding also occurred. That year was the first time people's houses were flooded for three months. Land transportation was cut off. PT GNI workers, who go to work via the Bunta Village road, also have to use boats.\nIt is true that there is usually a flood every five years in Bunta Village. However, since PT GNI came to close the river, the impact of the flooding has become worse, residents said.\nThe flood never stopped completely. Even in summer, residential land remains flooded with water.\n\"We can't stand it. \"To and fro the water,\" said Wahono.\nWahono has rice fields and oil palm plantations.

If they run out of water, please close. If they are excessive, open them. So that we can live together. But, no. They just closed.”\nWahono complained to the Governor of Central Sulawesi, Rusdy Mastura. Rusdy ordered his staff to go to the field.\nThe company's response was to raise the land surface of residential areas. The digging of a new river route was never granted. The house didn't sink anymore, but the puddle never disappeared.\nWahono's oil palm plantations and rice fields remain depleted.\"\n\nmedia.alkhairaat.id, 8/9/2022: WALHI Central Sulawesi Reveals Results of Investigation of Impact of Morut Nickel Company Activities\n\"The Forum for the Environment (WALHI) of Central Sulawesi Province (Sulteng) conducted an investigation regarding the presence and activities of the nickel mining company PT. Stardust Estate Investment (SEI) and PT. Gun Buster Nickel Industry (GNI) in North Morowali Regency (Morut).\nChairman of the WALHI Regional Council for Central Sulawesi, Richard Labiro, said that we found facts and this has become a problematic issue in the community, especially Bunta Village, East Petasia District and Tanauge Village, Petasia District, North Morowali Regency (Morut)...\nHe said that the impact they found was that from an environmental perspective, the existence of a steam power plant (PLTU), residents of Hamlet 5, Bunta Village were exposed to Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) resulting from burning coal.\n\"And in the early morning, residents there feel fog, but it's not the usual fog like before company activities,\" he said.\nAlthough he said, there has been no impact felt by local communities such as ISPA and others, but vulnerable groups who are threatened include mothers, the elderly and children.\nApart from that, he said, due to the company filling up the Lampi River, when it rains even a little, the Lampi River water overflows into the settlements, plantations, rice fields and livestock of the residents of V Transmigration Hamlet, Bunta Village.\n“Even though the company is responsible for this. But it doesn't solve the problem. \"The company excavated land in the area to fill in flooded roads,\" he explained.\nHe said, regarding the incident of water overflowing into residential areas and others, local residents had reported it to the Governor of Central Sulawesi, but until now there had been no solution.\nMeanwhile, the impact felt by Tanauge residents, he explained, was that compensation was not transparent and the payment was not open, there was no socialization of compensation prices to the community from the previous local government.\nApart from that, according to him, the agreement on the area for the construction of the Jetty between the company and the residents changed at the beginning when it was agreed that the area was 15 hectares, but as time went by it was suspected that the area would be more than 15 hectares.\n\"So the water area has been privatized by the company to build a ring road,\" he said.\nEven for the activities of barges and towing barges for parking in front of residential areas, there is a price set by the company to be paid to the community, but the payment is not enjoyed by the residents, due to problems with the local village government.\n\"On the other hand, the local community is worried that their availability of clean water will be affected due to the expansion of the company area,\" he said.\nBased on the results of the investigation carried out, he said, Walhi, as an organizer on labor issues, will strengthen residents affected by the company's activities. And will take legal action if there are indications of environmental violations.\"" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 121.4067949, -2.01153078 ] } },

At least the level of environmental pollution from industrial waste can be minimized.\n\"The question then is, why is the problem of environmental pollution in this area still occurring and is still occurring to this day. \"This means that there is something wrong with the waste management there, and to what extent the supporting budget for this has been used, whether it has been maximized and according to its intended purpose, or are you sure it is on target,\" explained Kadir.\nHe also questioned the implementation of the vision and mission by PT KIMA, which has a mission for a quality green industrial area and a vision to become a smart, modern and green area management company with the largest output.\n\"This is what PT KIMA must prioritize as the sole manager of the industrial area there. So basically all industrial companies in the area have tenant status. \"They rent tenants or space provided by PT KIMA and of course with supporting facilities including waste management facilities,\" said Kadir.\nHe asked APH to investigate more deeply the SOP for waste management managed by PT KIMA, starting from the inspection process, supervision, capacity or condition of waste storage areas, which of course should change along with the increasing activity of companies renting tenants or premises in the area.\n\"I think the focus should be here because it is related to the use of a very large budget which is related to the problem of environmental pollution due to the alleged impact of waste management which is still poor or not in accordance with existing regulations. \"We are waiting for APH's seriousness in investigating this case,\" Kadir stressed.\nPreviously, in a Hearing Meeting (RDP) discussing the issue of environmental pollution of the Tallo River tributary, Parangloe River, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District, Makassar which was initiated by Commission C of the Makassar City DPRD, a number of important points were revealed.\nOne of them, it was revealed that a number of companies in KIMA had fulfilled their obligation to pay money every month to PT. KIMA as the sole operator in the industrial area is related to waste management.\nThe obligations paid by a number of companies to KIMA are said to vary in value. Some make monthly deposits of IDR 4 million to IDR 5 million, depending on the volume of waste generated from the company's activities in question.\n\"Don't DLH or anyone else blame the companies at KIMA, don't say that PT at that time was like this and like this, the one responsible for the waste conditions at KIMA, not the businessman, he paid,\" said Chairman of Commission C of the Makassar City DPRD, Sangkala Saddiko while leading RDP discussed the issue of pollution of the Tallo River tributary, Parangloe River, Tamalanrea District, Makassar in the Makassar DPRD Banggar Room, Wednesday 17 May 2023.\n“How much does PT Wahyu pay? 4-5 million?. Well, he pays, so if waste like that occurs it is not the entrepreneur's responsibility, the responsibility is PT KIMA because this has been a long-standing problem. \"So where has KIMA been responsible for the past few years?\" Sangkala Saddiko said.\nHe admitted that he was surprised that the Makassar City Environmental Service (DLH), which was also present at the RDP, said that it had carried out inspections and so on. However, the problem of environmental pollution around KIMA is thought to be due to industrial waste still occurring.\n\"If the inspection was carried out intensively then nothing like this would happen. \"I admit that the environment is our partner. I always ask if he proposes regulations like that, but the question is why it still happens like that,\" said Sangkala Saddiko.\n\"Remember, all the entrepreneurs there are making payments, don't accuse this PT, this PT is responsible for the waste, what is clear is that I asked Indofood, I asked Sari Roti and so on, it all comes down to KIMA, because he said PT KIMA oversees waste matters, so \"That's not the responsibility of the entrepreneur, the responsibility is the manager, in this case PT KIMA,\" explained Sangkala Saddiko.\nHe said that he was elected from the Biringkanaya electoral district, Tamalanrea and knows exactly the problems experienced by the community regarding waste.\n\"I once said to the residents, can you still stand a smell like this? \"If it was in accordance with the existing progress, it wouldn't have happened like that. If, for example, it went like that, the entrepreneur at KIMA wanted to carry out his activities well, so he paid to comply with the existing regulations. I was sent proof of their payment,\" Sangkala Saddiko said again.\nHe also admitted that he was a regular road user in Kapasa Raya. That night he passed by and opened his car window. The stench approached.\n\"That's why I asked from the Environmental Service earlier, if the waste mechanism was running, it wouldn't have happened like that and this, sir, I was a member of the DPRD for two terms and passed by there every day, last night, sir, when I opened the glass door, I came in with a bad smell. \"It's not good, what DLH said earlier, according to the mechanism, it's like that,\" explained Sangkala Saddiko.\nThe PT KIMA representative who was present at the RDP explained that PT. KIMA has a number of companies under it and is bound by an agreement.\nWhen starting an agreement with the tenant, there is an attachment to the waste water quality standards required by the tenant.\n\"We have that,\" answered the PT KIMA representative in the RDP.\n\"Then related to how it is managed, from us it is 24 hour operational when it comes to temperature, PH, CO and DO every week, so we analyze all the required parameters according to the company every week a month,\" explained the PT KIMA representative.\nHe also explained that since 2022, PT KIMA has been required by the Ministry of the Environment to provide tools called sparing and sparing tools. And this tool has been installed at PT KIMA's waste water outlet to monitor the environment directly.\n\"That is an obligation that we have carried out,\" said the PT KIMA representative.\nRegarding environmental performance, he admitted that he had held PROPER since 2004. Where PT KIMA achieved blue PROPER. These are the environmental performances that the party will probably carry out at this time.\n\"Then regarding why the waste water that reaches the Tallo River tributary is black, actually if you look at our environmental documents, our documents were actually written from the start. \"Our responsibility extends to the water bodies before the Tallo River tributaries,\" explained the PT KIMA representative.\n\"However, looking at the current fact that along the canal created by KIMA, the community and all entrepreneurs outside KIMA have connected it, so in 2018 at the Ministry of the Environment we revised the document, the ministry issued that it could no longer be charged by PT KIMA related responsibility along the canal,\" continued the PT KIMA representative.\n\"Why, because along the canal there are many connections from terminals, from markets and all MSME businesses, entrepreneurs and all kinds of things are all there. \"So the responsibility for environmental control is transferred to us, so we can only reach the beach point at the Sector Police,\" added the PT KIMA representative.\nHe admitted that the problem now is because everything is connected. In the past, he continued, when the wall was still intact and then it was broken into by the Head of the Daya Village, he also asked a Makasaar City Government official who at that time was known as Manai Sofyan.\n\"I asked why the wall was broken into, it would be polluted by the community, he said where else would the community's water go if it didn't come this way. \"So that's the reason, I still remember that time I went down to the field and we saw that our channels were already connected,\" emphasized the PT KIMA representative.\nTallo River Tributary Pollution Complaint\nThe Makassar City Environmental Service (DLH) discovered several facts about alleged environmental pollution that occurred in the Parangloe River, a tributary of the Tallo River, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District.\nFirst, there was foam in the Parangloe River, then there were dead fish and shrimp in residents' ponds which were approximately 50 meters from the river location in question.\nThe facts found in the field were based on documentary evidence in the form of videos and photos reported by a resident of Bontoa village, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District regarding the presence of foam on the surface of water bodies that spread across the Parangloe River.\n\"Now after discovering this fact, the team carried out a cross-check in the field with the aim of identifying and collecting data as material for further analysis,\" said Acting Head of DLH Makassar City, Ferdi, Monday 15 May 2023.\nThen Ferdi revealed that reports of water pollution in the Parangloe River, which he admitted was thought to be the result of industrial activities, had been discovered the previous year by the monitoring team.\n\"So this data and verification will be a complement or support for follow-up material,\" he explained.\nThen there are several companies that operate from downstream points to the West Ring Road along the Parangloe River, namely PT. KTC, PT MT, PT BFM, PT FKS MA.tbk, PT CPI (RPHU).\n\"There are still several other companies that have not been identified,\" he explained.\nHowever, based on the results of interviews with people around the location, information was obtained that there were five residential drainage channels that flowed down to the Parangloe River.\n\"This has not been identified because the weather at that time was rainy,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the location of the drainage channel for the residents of Bontoa Village is the Komunai Waste Water Disposal Installation (IPAL) which was built by the Makassar City Public Works Department in 2019.\n\"According to the local RW, the IPAL is no longer used because there is a blockage in the channel so that residents' septic tank waste water automatically flows into the drainage and then into the river,\" he said.\nNot only that, some of the houses of Bontoa Village residents cross the banks of the Parangloe River, so it is estimated that domestic wastewater is directly discharged into the river.\n\"There is a narrowing of the width of the Parangloe river at coordinates 5° 5'47.93″S\n119°28'21.60\"E so that the river water does not flow smoothly and there is a buildup of sediment which causes a smell and black water,\" he explained.\nHowever, based on the results of field parameter tests, it was revealed that the Parangloe River is a tributary of the Tallo River which is located in two sub-districts, namely Tamalanrea and Biringkanaya.\nThe activities along the Parangloe River are residential, industrial and pond activities. So these activities affect the carrying capacity and water quality of the Parangloe River.\nIt could even be fatal if the population increases and industrial activities along the Parangloe River affect the environmental conditions of the Parangloe River.\n\"Domestic wastewater discharge originating from residential areas and industry that is not managed properly will cause sedimentation and river water quality. \"This can be seen physically in the condition of the Parangloe River water,\" he explained.\nApart from residents' domestic wastewater, industrial and pond activities also contribute to the water quality of the Parangloe River. Moreover, industries that do not treat their wastewater properly will cause public unrest.\nFerdi explained that the appearance of floating or foamy foam could also be concluded from natural factors, namely the natural cycle of rain falling from the sky or the discharge of waste water all at once.\n\"To find out this, integrated monitoring is carried out involving environmental monitoring functions,\" he added.

They also demanded that the company stop paying compensation or compassion to other parties suspected of acting on behalf of the land owner.  \n-Achmad Zakih , Secretary of the North Maluku Forestry Service, dismissed the threat of forests in Central Halmahera. However, he said that it is necessary to strengthen the existence of indigenous peoples who have lived and lived in the forest for generations through a stipulation through regional regulations.\"\"\n\nEnvironmental Justice Atlas: \"\"The IWIP and the associated nickel mining and processing activities have significant impacts on the environment, biodiversity, and the indigenous communities in the area [8]–[10]. Back in 2010, Indonesian community and advocacy groups JATAM (Mining Advocacy Network), WALHI, KIARA, and KAU formed an international coalition to oppose the project and the World Bank’s support of WBN [11]. The groups filed a complaint with the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) of the World Bank [11]. Earlier studies indicated that there were significant barriers to access meaningful redress for communities that are remote in the area [2].\nOver the years, the Indonesian government has been trying to resettle the indigenous group in the region outside the forest and force them to adopt conventional settled lifestyles instead of their traditional nomadic lifestyle. These people, called the O Hongana Manyawa (also referred to as Tobelo Dalam, which allegedly was against the wishes of the people themselves [11]) and means “forest people” in their indigenous language. They are one of the five last remaining nomadic Indigenous Peoples in Indonesia and categorized as endangered [3], [12] according to Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara (Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago, AMAN), the main representative organization for Indonesia’s indigenous peoples. According to an interview with Tupa, one of the members of the six remaining tribes that are still practicing the traditional nomadic lifestyle in the forest, “Trees are gone and replaced with the big road, where giant machines go in and out making noise and driving the animals away” [3]. For the few last remaining tribe members in the forest, the forest is not only a place to inhabitat and find sources of food, it is “also a home and ‘the bridge’ that connects them with the spiritual world” [3]. It was also reported that a local resident of Lelilef Sawai Village indicated that she and other mothers were prohibited from fishing in Tanjung Uli, Karkar, and Cacu and from taking firewood [9]. The reclamation of nickel ore storage areas by PT IWIP in the Karkar area also affected local fishing activities that used to take place in the same area [9].\nAccording to the fieldwork and report of Indonesian NGO AEER, the villagers of Lelilef Sawai, Lelilef Waibulan, and Gemaf complained about respiratory problems due to air pollution from the captive coal-fired power plants that use low calorie coal with a calorie content of only 4,200 kcal/kg [9]. Local residents also had restricted access to clean water, with the 3km Ake Sake River dammed and diverted for the construction of one of the IWIP smelters and other rivers such as Seslewe Sini and Kobe polluted [9]. AEER indicated that the increase of logging and the damming and diversion of the Ake Sake River has led to deforestation and reduced water absorption capacity and contributed to the flood that took place in August 2020 which inundated the villages and roads, including the IWIP area [9].\nDuring the inaugural ceremony of the IWIP project in 2018, IWIP claimed that they had obtained community consent and that Akejira nomads, which Tupa belongs to, had agreed to the nickel mining activity in Central Halmahera [3]. This was questioned by Munadi Kilkoda, the regional chief of AMAN Malut (North Maluku) [13]. Some local residents had no other choice but to sell land to the company and the bid price from the companies was  low (e.g. IDR 8,000-9,000 per sq metre, equal to around half a euro) based on regional regulations [9]. While the majority of residents have sold their land, a few have refused to do so. It was reported that “intimidation by security forces, and dispossession of access to forest and other social and environmental concerns have sparked protest and denunciations of the projects” [11]. Some protests took place in 2019 by the relatives of O Hongana Manyawa band that live in Akejira forest [3]. Another protest took place in July 2020, when 450 South Wasile residents walked for two days to Kao Rahai, where PT WBN was opening a new nickel mining area, and blockaded roads by building tents and halting mining activities [9].\nIn addition, there were protests from students and civil society organizations in Ternate. AMAN urged IWIP to 1) comply with international laws and treaties including ILO Convention 169 and the UN Declaration on the rights of the indigenous peoples; 2) implement free, prior, informed consent (FPIC) on all forms of policies before operations that affect the livelihood of indigenous peoples; and 3) comply with Indonesian law, especially the Constitutional Court Decision Number 35/PUU-X/2012 regarding customary forests (not state forests) [3]. Students protested in Ternate and in Tobelo, North Halmahera, including the Student Action Solidarity for the Indonesian People (Samurai) Malut and the Sylfa Student Association of Kharun University [5], [14], [15]. The latter held a protest with the theme “Save Ake Jira, the Heart of Halmahera and the Tobelo Dalam Tribe”. The students demanded that the Halteng Regency Government ratify a local regulation on indigenous peoples in order to protect this tribe [5],[3]. IWIP representative responded [16] that they had obtained a borrow-to-use forest area permit (IPPKH) and that the Tobelo Dalam community is one of the main stakeholders in their mining concession, with whom they had developed a good relationship [5]. On the other hand, the issue of Ake Jira’s customary forest reached the Presidential Secretariat Office (KSP) in Jakarta with a letter sent by AMAN Malut that complained about the issues faced by the indigenous people of Tobelo Dalam in Central Halmahera after the arrival of WBN and IWIP in the area [16]. KSP issued a letter that urged the companies to respect and protect the indigenous people of Tobelo Dalam and align with the recommendations put forward by AMAN [16].\nOn 23 October 2019, another demonstration was held by Aliansi Masyarakat Ake Jira Halmahera (the Ake Jira Halmahera Community Alliance, AMARAH) in front of the Ternate Mayor’s office [17]. The crowd carried banners reading \"\" Selamatkan Ake Jira” (“Save Ake Jira”) and asked for the revocation of the Mining Business Permit (IUP) of IWIP, WBN and PT Tekindo Energy [17]. The AMARAH alliance is a coalition of NGOs, civic organizations, movements, and student associations, including Walhi Malut, AMAN Malut, LBH Marimoi, Daurmala, FNKSD, Sekolah Critis, GeMPAR, SAMURAI, LMND, GAMHAS, The Buas, PANDECTA, KAMMI IAIN, Jendela Mahasiswa Politik, Pusmat, Gemah IAIN, Jejak Timur, SEMUT, DEMA Ekonomi IAIN, and Gerilya Institut [17]. A representative of the demonstrators indicated that the mining activities in the Ake Jira forest not only threatens the Tobelo Dalam, but also has an impact on the waterbody in the region [17]. It was also indicated that the residents of Tobelo Dalam that lived in Ake Jira had left their original residential area due to massive mining activities, while AMARAH representative did not know where they had left for at the moment [14], [17].\"\"\"\n\nEnvironmental Concerns:\nEnvironmental Justice Atlas: \"According to the fieldwork and report of Indonesian NGO AEER, the villagers of Lelilef Sawai, Lelilef Waibulan, and Gemaf complained about respiratory problems due to air pollution from the captive coal-fired power plants that use low calorie coal with a calorie content of only 4,200 kcal/kg [9].

The company operates in residential areas\nArdi said KIBA is located in the coastal area of ​​Pa'jukukang District, Bantaeng. The land area of ​​this national strategic project reaches 3,151 hectares.\"To support the company's activities, an export port and a 101 hectare wind power plant will be built in the Pa'jukukang waters,\" said Ardi.vPT Huadi is the first smelter factory to be inaugurated in Bantaeng in January 2019 at KIBA. According to the local community, the company is said to have exported 15 times, starting from November 2018.vThere are three companies operating at KIBA. Namely, PT Huadi, Yatai and Wozhou. The company's operations are right next to the settlements of coastal residents in Papanloe Village. The seven hamlets in the village are directly affected by the activities of companies that produce materials for nickel raw materials.vThe coastal area of ​​Pa'jukukang is said to be designated as KIBA because it is considered dry and the land is unproductive. Even though most of the people there work as fishermen, seaweed farmers, the red stone manufacturing industry, and there are also rice fields. \"Especially in Papanloe Village, there are still 160 seaweed farmers, 114 of whom depend on the seaweed business,\" Ardi explained his data.\n2. The company's activities destroy the source of income for residents\nArdi said the activity of material transport ships disrupted farmers' seaweed cultivation. Seaweed locations that meet directly with ports and ship lanes are often damaged by being hit by ships. As a result, the location of the stretch of seaweed is damaged and unable to continue cultivation. Not only disrupting seaweed cultivation, the activities of material transport vessels also disrupt fishermen's fishing grounds. Of the seven hamlets in Papanloe Village, Mawang Hamlet is the hamlet that feels the most impact from the company's activities. The common impact that occurs is pollution. \"Such as smell, dust and noise,\" said Ardi. Dust, sourced from several company activities. Such as dust from material transport vehicles that use village roads as well as public access roads used by residents. Another source of dust, comes from drying the ore to the burning process through the furnace. The combustion process is also a source of dust as well as emits a pungent odor. \"To describe the smell, residents call it the smell of scorched canvas. The noise for 24 hours comes from heavy equipment activity in the company area, material transport car activities, and sounds in the form of bangs,\" said Ardi. Not to mention the problem of drought. In September 2021, the residents' wells in the Balla Tinggia hamlet, Kayu Loe and Mawang hamlet, Papanloe Village dried up. The drought is thought to have been caused by the drilled wells built in the three companies' areas. As a result of the identification, there were 18 residents' wells that had dried up. Even though the well is used for the daily needs of local residents. \"Before it dries up, the residents use the well for bathing and washing, as well as meeting the water needs for making or for the production of red stone,\" said the resident of Papanloe Village.\n3. Companies at KIBA are considered disobeying and ignoring the rules\nFurthermore, Ardi explained, from the start of socialization by the government, companies at KIBA would prioritize recruiting local workers. The goal is that the people living around KIBA can improve their standard of living. But in practice, the company is considered to be in denial. Instead, they recruit more workers from outside. \"The company has not prioritized Papanloe residents in recruiting employees. Of the total number of employees as of October 2021, there were 1,255 people, while there were only 220 employees from Papanloe Village,\" said Ardi. Ardi added, residents have also taken various ways to submit their demands to the company. Starting from the village government to the local DPRD. \"But the problem really is with the company. Because it works without looking at the EIA, so there are a lot of impacts,\" he added. Confirmed separately, Community Development (Condev) PT.

PT KIPI did not respond to a request for comment. Residents hope the project may bring jobs, but worry they will lose their traditional livelihoods as fishermen, farmers and increasingly, eco-tourism hosts as dust and ash smother their fields. An analysis by CELIOS of PT KIPI’s environmental impact assessment forecasts the the problems will worsen once the project begins operating.\n“The effects of hot water waste contamination, coal-fired power plant fly ash, rising air temperatures, project smoke, noise, sea dredging, and spilt coal/fuel spills will cause the sea to become murky, which will cause tourism (industry) to decrease and the quality and quantity of (fish) catches to significantly decrease,” it said.\"\n\nEnvironmental concerns:\nEnvironmental groups in Indonesia and abroad have raised concerns and staged protests over the proposed building of new captive coal power plants for the industrial park. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 of KIPI’s development, Adaro plans to build approximately 1000 MW capacity of coal power plants in each phase, before the anticipated hydroelectric power plants are ready to operate. In February 2023, it was reported that Adaro was having trouble finding financing for the development of their coal power plants, as many international banks that Adaro had previously borrowed from had pledged to stop supporting new coal projects (ft.com, 2/6/2023). Environmental groups also called out Hyundai, who plans to use aluminum from the smelter for electric vehicle production, for violating its own carbon neutrality principles. At Adaro’s 2023 annual shareholders’ meeting in May, two of its own shareholders protested against the planned captive power plants (news.mongabay.com, 6/15/2023). Mongabay also reported that it is unlikely the captive coal plants will be shut down in 2030, once hydropower is available, as the master plan for KIPI designates a zone of the park that is permitted to use power from coal power plants (news.mongabay.com, 6/15/2023). In May 2023, Adaro had only secured funding from domestic Indonesian banks for the first phase of the coal power plant development (1,060 MW capacity) (adaro.com, 5/16/2023).\n\napnews.com, 9/14/2023: New Indonesian industrial park on Borneo, feted as ‘green,’ will be powered by coal, report says\n\"...The environmental impact assessment commissioned by PT Kalimantan Industrial Park Indonesia, which operates a large part of the current development, describes what is happening in the 15,000 hectare (32,100 acre) area, where plumes of dust mushroom into the sky along the Celebes Sea as heavy equipment fells trees and razes paddy fields.\nIt says the project’s coastal zone is a conservation and migration area for green turtles, hawksbill turtles and killer whales. Hawksbill turtles are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while green turtles are considered endangered.\nHis wooden boat rocking as excavators and construction trucks roar nearby, fisherman Erwin laments the constant ship traffic delivering supplies to the remote area.\n'We are looking for fish further and further away from the beach because there are lots of ships in the area driving fish away,' said Erwin, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. 'If (the industrial park) is built, I don’t know what the future holds but it’s clear that it will definitely have an impact (and) hurt my income.'\"\n\nnew.mongabay.com, 6/15/2023: Indonesian coal giant Adaro’s ‘sustainable’ smelter slammed as ‘greenwashing’\n\"Indonesia’s largest coal miner, PT Adaro Energy, faces claims of greenwashing over its plan to build coal-fired power plants on the island of Borneo to provide electricity for its aluminum smelter there.\nAt its annual shareholders’ meeting in Jakarta on May 11, two shareholders protested against the planned captive power plants, known as such because they’re designed specifically to supply certain industries and not to feed into the grid.\n“Stop the development of new coal plants. One billion people will be threatened by the climate crisis due to coal plants,” one of the shareholders shouted while being escorted out of the meeting.\nThe plants, with a combined capacity of 2.2 gigawatts, will supply Adaro’s aluminum smelter in an industrial park, itself branded as “green,” in North Kalimantan province. The park is being touted, once completed, as the largest of its kind in the world, home to Indonesia’s first electric vehicle battery production, alongside petrochemical and aluminum industries.\nThe smelter project, estimated to cost $2 billion, has entered the preconstruction phase and is expected to start commercial operation in 2025. Once running at full capacity in 2029, it will be able to produce 1.5 million metric tons of aluminum a year, the company says.\nAluminum is used in the lithium nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide (NCA) cathodes that are the most widely cathodes currently found in EV batteries. Because of this, and the adjacent EV battery plant in the industrial park, Adaro is marketing the aluminum smelter project as a flagship green and renewable development for Indonesia.\n“Seeing the future development of electric vehicle (EV), the Company is ready to participate in providing aluminium for the EV’s material and support green economy for sustainable living,” Adaro said in a filing to the Jakarta stock exchange.\nBut building the smelter will start with building the coal-fired power plants to run them. Only later, in 2030, will the smelter switch to using power from a hydroelectric plant.\nAdaro said that while the main power source for the industrial park will be renewables, coal will still be needed in the initial stages of the smelter as it takes longer to build renewable power plants.\nBinbin Mariana, Southeast Asia energy finance campaigner at climate group Market Forces, noted that state-owned aluminum producer PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum) is also building a smelter in North Sumatra province — powered by two hydro plants.\n“By using hydropower plants, the cost of the aluminium production is much cheaper compared to using coal-fired power plants,” she said. “The cost if using hydropower is less than 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour, compared to 6 to 8 U.S. cents if using coal.”\nAnd even after Adaro makes the switch in 2030, it’s not clear whether the captive coal plants will be decommissioned, according to the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS), a Jakarta-based research institute.\n“Is there any guarantee that when the hydropower plant is ready, the captive coal plants will be shut down? No,” CELIOS executive director Bhima Yudhistira said.\nHe added that’s because the master plan for the “green” industrial park explicitly allows coal power: the estate’s environmental impact assessment maps out two zones, green and blue, with factories and smelters in the blue zone permitted to use power from coal plants.\nEven using the best available technology to minimize emissions, the captive plants will still emit an estimated 5.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gases per year, according to Market Forces.\nGreenpeace Indonesia energy campaigner Bondan Andriyanu said this goes against the Indonesian government’s pledge to phase out coal and switch to renewables in a bid to mitigate climate change. The planned coal plants will also dash any hope of meeting the wider goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5° Celsius (2.7° Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.\nThe International Energy Agency says there can be no new coal-fired power plants after 2021 if the world is to stay within this threshold, agreed on by nations including Indonesia in the Paris climate pact to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.\n“The development of a new coal plant will only exacerbate the impact of the climate crisis, pollute the environment, harm the people and Indonesia’s commitment in reducing carbon emissions from the energy sector,” Bondan said.\nLess money for coal\nNabilla Gunawan, Indonesia campaigner for Market Forces, called the smelter project “greenwashing” since it’s being marketed as sustainable. With other environmental groups also pointing this out, Adaro has reportedly struggled to raise money from international banks to finance the project.\nThe company had planned to get $1.1 billion in bank loans to help meet the $2 billion price tag, but several global banks that had previously done business with Adaro now say they won’t finance the smelter. This includes Singapore’s DBS and OCBC, and the U.K.’s Standard Chartered.\nFor coal companies like Adaro, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to get funding as a growing number of banks and investment funds announce their commitments to tackling climate change by no longer funding industries that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, according to Binbin of Market Forces.\nMany of these institutions are part of the U.N.’s Net-Zero Banking Alliance, accounting for about 40% of global banking assets. To date, 115 banks in 41 countries have joined the alliance.\nThat leaves a shrinking pool of banks willing to fund coal, especially for companies like Adaro, which not only plans to build new power plants, but also still has plans to prospect for new coal reserves, Binbin said.\n“What’s funny is that if you look at Adaro’s annual report in 2021, it says that they’re still exploring new mines,” she said.\nAdaro’s coal production hit a record high in 2022, amounting to 62.8 million metric tons, a 19% increase from the 52.7 million tons it mined in 2021, casting further doubt on the company’s commitment to transition away from coal.\nAdaro Minerals, the subsidiary in charge of the smelter project, has denied that the company is struggling to get funding for the project.\n“The rumor is not true,” Adaro Minerals director Wito Krisnahadi said as quoted by CNBC Indonesia, adding that they’ve been able to secure financing from at least five banks.\nWito declined to name the banks.\nAdaro Energy’s head of corporate communications, Febriati Nadira, said separately that the company is in the process of finalizing the deal to finance the project.\nAdaro Minerals has also denied allegations of greenwashing. President director Christian Ariano Rachmat said the company remains committed to transitioning toward green energy, but will need time to build the hydropower plant to meet the aluminum smelter’s demand for electricity.\nChristian also said that three-quarters of aluminum smelters around the world still use coal, hence Adaro’s case wasn’t an outlier.\n“One day, we want to produce green aluminium, but it needs time to get there, at least until our hydro [plant] is finished,” he said.\nHyundai driving into controversy\nBesides Adaro, critics have also gone after South Korean automobile giant Hyundai, which signed an agreement in November 2022 to buy aluminum from Adaro for its EV production. Hyundai described the aluminum as “green and low-carbon” because it would be produced using hydroelectric power, and thus would “accelerate” the transition to sustainable energy and help the company meet its net-zero emissions goal by 2045.\nBut the agreement fails to mention that hydropower will only come into the mix at a later stage, with the smelter initially relying on burning coal. That makes any purchase of aluminum from Adaro’s smelters a violation of Hyundai’s Carbon Neutrality Principles, Binbin said.\nThose principles require Hyundai to cut not just its own emissions, but also those emissions associated with assets it doesn’t own — like the aluminum it plans to buy from Adaro. These are known as Scope 3 emissions, and in 2022 Hyundai reported 18.3 million metric tons of Scope 3 emissions from its supply chain, up from 17 million metric tons in 2021.\n“This means that this 18 million tons of emissions have to be reduced,” Binbin said. “But if Hyundai buys aluminium from Adaro, the emissions [from its supply chain] will increase. So this doesn’t make any sense.”\nUPDATE: On 12 May 2023, the deal to finance the smelter project reached financial closing. A group of five Indonesian domestic banks – Mandiri Bank, Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), Bank Central Asia (BCA), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), Permata Bank – provided a total of 2.5 trillion rupiah (US$166.8 million) and US$1.5 billion loans to Adaro’s smelter and coal power plant subsidiaries, Kalimantan Aluminium Industry (KAI), and Kaltara Power Indonesia (KPI).\"\n\nPetrominer.com, 3/14/2023: Signed MoU with Adaro, Questioned Hyundai's Climate Commitment\n\"A coalition of environmental organizations from Indonesia and South Korea has raised concerns over the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by Hyundai Motor Company and PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia Tbk. The reason is that, based on the MoU, Hyundai can buy a maximum of 100,000 tons of aluminum per year from Adaro. Meanwhile, Adaro plans to build a new 1.1 GW coal-fired power plant as an energy source to produce aluminum.\nResponding to this problem, 10 environmental organizations from Indonesia and Korea have sent an objection letter to Hyundai on January 24, 2023. They also expressed their concerns over the cooperation plan, but until now Hyundai has not responded.\n\"We have expressed our concerns and sent a letter to Hyundai in January, but until now Hyundai has not updated our letter,\" said Campaigner from Market Forces, Nabilla Gunawan, Monday (13/3).\nAccording to Nabilla, this partnership with Adaro is in direct conflict with Hyundai's climate commitments. The reason is that Hyundai failed to take into account the consequences of building a new coal-fired power plant on the climate and environment.\n\"Hyundai has reneged on its commitment to environmentally friendly vehicles by using aluminum produced using a new coal-fired power plant,\" he said.\nEven though Adaro labels this aluminum smelter project as an 'environmentally friendly' project, the initial phase of the smelter will use electricity from a new coal fired power plant. In fact, the average PLTU in the world operates for 46 years, meaning that it will be difficult for Hyundai to achieve the carbon neutral target in 2045 if Hyundai still relies on aluminum produced from Adaro's coal energy.\n\"Electric vehicle consumers are increasingly skeptical that the goal of the energy transition is still littered with the massive use of coal,\" said Bhima Yudhistira from the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS).\nOn the previous occasion, the National Coordinator of the Mining Advocacy Network (JATAM), Melky Nahar, said that Indonesia does not need new coal-fired power plants which clearly pollute and damage the environment. Companies like Adaro have a history of destroying people's lives and have contributed to environmental disasters such as floods and landslides in Kalimantan.”\n“We were very concerned about Hyundai signing a memorandum of understanding to purchase aluminum produced by Adaro, when it became clear that the production would be supported by a new coal-fired power plant. Hyundai should not support dirty aluminum production by Adaro and encourage low-carbon investment in Indonesia,\" said Melky.\nCurrently, Adaro's aluminum smelter is known to have a planned capacity of 1.5 million tons per year in 2029. Adaro plans to rely on coal-fired power plants in the early stages, then add capacity from hydropower in the final stage.\"" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 117.8590457, 2.528752567 ] } },

The community submitted a report document containing traces of environmental and humanitarian crimes from NCKL company’s operations in Kawasi, Obi Island, South Halmahera, North Maluku Province.\nThe Harita Group subsidiary is projected to gain an increase in net worth from USD 1.1 billion to USD 4.6 billion. This action was carried out to convey to brokers, as public intermediaries in buying and selling shares related to the dangers of investing in NCKL.\nPT Trimegah Bangun Persada Tbk (NCKL) is a subsidiary of Harita Group that operates the first High Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) smelter on Obi Island, North Maluku. The company produces 60,000 tons of nickel per year. HPAL technology will convert local low-grade ore into mixed hydroxide deposits, a form of nickel that can further be processed to make batteries.\nIn its operations, PT Trimegah Bagun Persada, along with PT Gane Sentosa Permai, PT Halmahera Persada Lygend, PT Megah Surya Pertiwi, and PT Halmahera Jaya Feronickel on Obi Island, all companies under the auspices of Harita Group, have devastated the land / plantation land of residents, polluted water sources, river water, and sea water, polluted the air due to dust and pollution that has an impact on the health of residents, to trigger social conflicts due to intimidation and repeated violence against residents who defend their living spaces. PT Trimegah Bangun Persada and  a number of other companies owned by Harita Group also unilaterally annexed residents’ land without fair negotiation and compensation.\n“Lili Mangundap and four other families who owned land in Kawasi village were annexed by the company. The company and the South Halmahera Regency government also plan to relocate Kawasi residents to Eco Village Housing, located 5 kilometers to the south of Kawasi. For residents, this relocation not only removes them from their homes, but also robs them of their cultural and historical values. Not only that, residents are also excluded from their sources of life such as land, fields, and the sea,” said Muhammad Jamil, Head of the Legal Division of JATAM Nasional.\nHarita Group’s mining operations resulted in polluted water sources of Kawasi residents and sedimentation of nickel ore from the company’s operations. Before the mine came in and operated, residents could get water for free, but now they have to spend money to get clean water. This condition makes it more difficult for residents who are economically deprived because they are forced to use polluted water sources. PT Trimegah Bangun Persada and other Harita Group-owned companies in the region dump waste into rivers and flow into the sea. This causes the coast and sea to turn cloudy-brownish. The marine ecosystem on Obi Island is damaged by sewage pipes leading to the sea. The fish that have been consumed by residents are also contaminated with heavy metals.\nIn addition to pollution in the sea, the company’s activities are so close to settlements, that residents are forced to deal with dust, noise, and a dirty environment. During the dry season, kitchen utensils, dining tables, chairs, floors, and even in the room are full of dust from company activities and coal dust. Based on information from residents and officials at Kawasi health clinic, acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most important health problem in Kawasi. Most patients are toddlers. There were 124 infants aged 0-1 years who visited the health clinic from January to December 2021. Toddlers aged 1-5 years were recorded as many as 283, followed by the age group of 20-44 years as many as 179 people.\nIn addition to bringing health problems, Harita Group’s operations also ignore the OHS Compliance aspect of its workers. Throughout 2022, the mining and mineral processing sector dominated accidents in North Maluku, especially belonging to Harita Group. Based on media reports, in the 2019-2023 time frames, 8 cases were recorded with 2 victims died and 5 people were injured. This fact refutes Harita Group’s claim that there were no casualties due to work accidents. In nickel mining operations, Harita Group, through PT Halmahera Persada Lygend (HPL), also uses coal-fired power plants for operations. The total capacity of the coal-fired power plant is 210 MW. PT HPL is a joint venture between Harita Group and Ningbo Lygend from China which has around 2,030 MW of coal-fired power plants in the process of construction and pre-permitting. The company also targets a total of 4,200 MW of coal-fired power plants on Obi Island. The construction of the power plant violates the commitment of Chinese President, Xi Jinping, through his speech in 2021, which stated that he would not build new power plants abroad.\n“With all the environmental and social damage made by Harita Group, the company has underwriters, namely Credit Suisse Group, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Mandiri Sekuritas, DBS, OCBS Securities, and UOB Kay Hian. six underwriters from Harita Group companies -except Mandiri Sekuritas, are members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. Their collaboration with Harita Group certainly undermines GFANZ’s commitment itself in supporting the achievement of zero emission targets and a just clean energy transition,” said Novita Indri, a campaigner from Trend Asia.\"\n\nindoprogress.com, 1/14/2023: Details unfair land compensation case of Lily Mangudap, environmental degradation and pollution of water sources, increased resident health problems, lack of access to electricity, forced relocation\n\nMongabay.co.id, 12/9/2022: Surrounded by Nickel Industry, Kawasi Residents Face Environmental Problems, Protest Village Relocation\n-  \"The community consisting of religious leaders, traditional leaders, village government and cross-organizations approached the South Halmahera DPRD, questioning the news about the Kawasi Village relocation plan after the nickel mining company, PT Harita Group, began operating on Obi Island.

This project was invested with Ningbo Lygend Resources Technology and Indonesia Harita Group.\nThe coal-fired power plant project with a capacity of 4×380 MW is build to support the laterite nickel ore smelter project which is also located on Obi Island. The first phase of the project includes the construction and installation of the system. The target is that the CPP is claimed to supply energy sources for the development of nickel smelters as raw materials for the battery industry...This project also has a negative impact on the people living around the project area. Lily Mangundap, as in her interview in Project Multatuli, said that this nickel smelter industry project had slowly “killed” her and her family. The company PT Trimegah Bangun Persada, a subsidiary of the Indonesia Harita Group, forcibly evicted its plantation land to expand its concession by building a nickel smelter. The land that was Lily’s source of livelihood disappeared and turned into the Obi Island Industrial Estate, which produces nickel ore as the raw material for batteries for electric vehicles.\"\n\nmongabay.co.id, 11/14/2021: \" Obi Island, in South Halmahera, North Maluku, has built a nickel downstream industrial area and built a factory for the production of electric vehicle battery raw materials.

It’s been quiet on this island for most of his life. Without a private jet, getting to Obira from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, is at least a two-day journey involving an overnight ferry and hours of driving on roads stippled with potholes.\nLiyus, who goes by one name, said he used to drink from the rivers that run past his village, but since the nickel mine added its acid-leaching refinery two years ago, the waterways have turned dark red, so thick with pollution at some points that rows of coconut trees have been killed off. He doesn’t know what’s in the water, only that it bleeds into the sea and that his nephews have had to go farther and farther out to find fish. He pointed to a fishing net drying on a nearby tree. It was stained a reddish brown.\nIn an hour-long interview, representatives from the two companies that jointly own the processing plant on Obira island — an Indonesian firm, Harita Group, and a Chinese firm, Lygend Resources — said that the operation has not had a negative impact on the environment and that the pollution along the coast was not related to waste produced by their plant. All of their operations, they emphasized, are in “full compliance” with government requirements. “We looked at what was the best and we confirmed it with the government,” said Tonny Gultom, Harita’s head of health, safety and environment...\nThe nickel mine on Obira has been operated by Harita since 2016, but in 2018, Lygend joined to plan, design and construct the HPAL refinery, eventually acquiring a majority stake in the project. The processing facility, which was designated a priority for the national government, opened in 2021.\nAfter the companies withdrew their initial plan to dump the HPAL waste into the sea, they told authorities that they would store the waste on land, drying out the acidic slurry before dumping it back into the mining pit, and then treating the residue water in a tailings “pond.”\nOnly a year earlier, however, Harita executives had published a research article in a science journal stating that land disposal on Obira is actually “less suitable” because the region is in a notoriously active seismic zone — as recently as 2019, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake devastated a port town on Bacan island, less than 50 miles from Obira — and is frequently visited by heavy rainfall. That article also noted that about 7,000 villagers lived downstream from the site, concluding that the construction and water control required for land disposal was “not feasible.”\nAsked about those findings, a Harita spokesman acknowledged that storing the waste on land is dangerous but said the company is managing the risks by drying out the slurry and dumping it back into the mining pit, where it is prevented from seeping into local waterways.\nBut a foreign mining consultant who has been working on projects in Indonesia for more than two decades said: “It’s a massive heap of waste. And if it’s not stored properly, you can have landslides. That’s my biggest concern.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of business considerations...\nFour international mining experts independently reviewed photos of the mining site at Obira taken by The Washington Post. The experts said that it was impossible without a formal audit to ascertain whether Harita and Lygend were dumping HPAL tailings into the sea, but that there were multiple signs that the companies were generally failing to contain mining waste.\nThe photos show “devastating” levels of deforestation, which can increase the risks of tailings accidents, said Aimee Boulanger, executive director of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, an organization that audits mining operations and measures them against social and environmental standards. Even if tailings were not being actively pumped into the sea, there don’t appear to be “any significant controls” over what’s flowing out of the mine and entering waterways, she added.\nSam Riggall, an advocate of responsible mining and the chief executive of Sunrise Energy Metals, an Australian nickel and cobalt mining company, said the material entering the rivers around the mining facility resembled processed waste, rather than just runoff from open-pit mines...\nGultom, Harita’s head of safety, acknowledged that the HPAL refinery was producing a “huge volume” of waste that could pose safety risks if not properly managed, but he stressed that it was being handled with adequate precautions.\nThe discolored water near Obira’s coast, he said, was caused by sedimentation created by timber mining years ago. “It has nothing,” Gultom said, “to do with us.”\nHarita, which debuted on the Jakarta stock exchange in April, plans to add a second processing plant on Obira next year, company executives said.\"\n\nindoprogress.com, 1/14/2023: Details unfair land compensation case of Lily Mangudap, environmental degradation and pollution of water sources, increased resident health problems, lack of access to electricity, forced relocation\n\nMongabay.co.id, 12/9/2022: Surrounded by Nickel Industry, Kawasi Residents Face Environmental Problems, Protest Village Relocation\n-  \"The community consisting of religious leaders, traditional leaders, village government and cross-organizations approached the South Halmahera DPRD, questioning the news about the Kawasi Village relocation plan after the nickel mining company, PT Harita Group, began operating on Obi Island.

The state-owned mining company that has been reaping annual net profit of around Rp1.15 trillion, has also been dumping waste from its nickel mining operations high up on the hill, to the coast.\nThe waste released by the company that has been operating there since 2006, has now covered and polluted the bottom of the coastal area. Anas says that the place where he is now standing, was once teeming with corals, a habitat for fishes and other marine life.\nHis father, who was a fisherman from Sulawesi and moved to the area under the government’s sponsored transmigration program in the 1980s, often recounted that there used to be so many fishermen working in Moronopo Bay but now no more.\n“The mackerels which are commonly consumed by people were a staple. But now their habitat has been destroyed,” Anas said during an interview in mid-May.\nThe Moronopo Bay is administratively located in Soasangaji village, in the Kota Maba sub-district of East Halmahera, North Maluku. It takes five hours to reach the area from Sofifi, the main town in North Maluku.\nThe East Halmahera Environment Agency has noted that the waste sedimentation had covered an area of four hectares. At the farthest point from the coastline, about 100 meters from the source of the waste disposal, the waste layer, consisting of mud and rock, rises up to almost one meter from the beach surface.\nThe company tried to cover the waste by planting mangroves but Anas said it was a failed attempt as the waste continued to flow into the bay and the mangrove could not survive, in contrast to the naturally grown mangroves in the area.\nIn one corner where mangrove seedlings had just been planted, a board that says “PT Antam Mangrove Planting Conservation” sticks out from the ground. The board also indicates the first mangrove was planted in 2009.\n“So, these mangroves were planted in hopes to reduce the impacts of the waste pollution and it has been done several times, but they are still a far cry from the massive scale of their mining activities,” Anas said.\nThe worsening condition of the Moronopo bay is what prompted local residents to hold a protest on April 7, 2021, demanding that Antam cease all its mining activities. There was no response from the company.\nThe nickel mining operation on top of the hill in the Moronopo Bay area, is part of a mining concession owned by Antam and will expire in 2040. The concession of some 39,000 hectares, or more than half of the surface of the nation’s capital, Jakarta, straddled two subdistricts – Maba and Kota Maga.\nAntam is also mining nickel in Tanjung Buli, Maba subdistrict, since 2001; and in Pakal Island, in Kota Maba subdistrict, since 2011.\nIn 1998, Antam started mining nickel in Gee Island, Maba. The island has entered rehabilitation phase, although remnants of exploitation of the area remain evident.\nIn 2012, Antam also built a nickel refinery in Tanjung Buli but this facility is not yet in operation, while the permit will expire in 2032.\nThe company that was established not long after the establishment of the New Order, has been exploiting mineral in these two subdistricts of East Halmahera for more than two decades.\"\n\ntandaseru.com, 4/7/2021: 2 Meters of Mud on the Shoreline, East Halmahera Residents Demonstrate Antam\n\"A number of residents of East Halmahera Regency , North Maluku Province, staged an action at the Moronopo mining site owned by PT Aneka Tambang, Wednesday (7/4).\nThis is because local residents think that Antam is not serious about handling mining waste which has caused the nearby coast to be filled with 2 meters of mud.\nThis action was led by Kapita Sangaji Maba Haltim, Ibrahim Haruna. This action was triggered by public unrest who accused Antam of polluting the environment with its mining waste.\n\"Because this mining location has practically been active for years, but until now in handling environmental pollution there has been no seriousness from Antam itself,\" said Udin, one of the demonstrators.\nThe demonstrators also demanded that mining activities in Moronopo be stopped before fixing environmental pollution at that location.\n“Environmental problems in Moronopo have been going on for decades. So we, the people who attended, hoped that this would not be considered a trivial matter, because when we dived on the beach the mud was more than 2 meters. It means that this mining location has to be moved, bearing in mind that PT Antam's mining area is large,\" continued Udin.\nMeanwhile, Kapita Sangaji, Ibrahim Haruna, in front of members of the East Halmahera DPRD and the company, who at that time also immediately checked the location, said that seeing the waste at the Moronopo mining site which had not been handled so far, the government and DPRD were expected to take steps to deal with the waste that had have piled up on the beach.\n\"So the government and DPRD are trying to pay attention to this waste, because this is a matter of the needs of the people of Haltim,\" he said.\nThe demonstrators also promised to continue to oversee the process of improving environmental pollution.

Along with easing the pandemic, we hope this government-private synergy will be able to revive the community's economy.\"\"\n\"\"This MoU between PLN and PT BAI is to prepare electrical energy for the aluminium mining industry. PLN is committed to providing sufficient power to develop the industrial sector. The hope is that it can spur national economic growth, \"\"Adi said.\nAdi explained that according to the agreement, PLN will provide 1,300 megawatts (MW) of electricity for PT BAI until 2050. However, the supply will be carried out in stages, namely 300 MW in 2026, 500 MW in 2027, and 1,300 MW in 2029-2050.\nIn this provision, PLN will prioritize the power supply from new renewable energy (EBT) based plants with massive potential in Sumatra.\nAdi added, \"\"Currently, PLN's electricity supply for the Sumatra region is already qualified with a power surplus of 1,710 MW. As the capacity of NRE power plants increases in 2026, there will be enough power available that the mining community in Sumatra can absorb.\"\"\nPT BAI's President Director, Santoni, welcomed the signing of this MoU because it will support the aluminium utilization industry in the Galang Batang SEZ. Especially for PT BAI, that will be building an aluminium smelter with a production capacity of 250,000 tonnes of aluminium annually.\n\"\"This cooperation will be mutually beneficial. The aluminium industry and its derivatives require a large amount of electrical energy. Especially for the Galang Batang SEZ, we will need 2,850 MW in the near future,” said Santoni.\nSantoni continued that PT BAI will follow government regulations to use EBT-based electricity in supplying electrical energy. So, according to him, the MoU with PLN is an alternative for the provision of EBT for PT BAI.\n\"\"Hopefully, through this MoU, PLN can provide reliable and economical electricity supply. Hopefully, the realization of this collaboration can build a productive smelter for the downstream industry of aluminium derivatives and various other industries that will be present in the Galang Batang SEZ,\"\" explained Santoni.\nAgung Murdifi, the PLN Main Unit General Manager for Riau and Riau Islands, said, \"\"This momentum was an opportunity for both parties to increase the supply and use of EBT in the industrial sector.

The value of bauxite will increase by around 5–13 times if it is processed into aluminum. Galang Batang SEZ which has an area of ​​2,300 hectares is focused on processing bauxite into alumina or aluminum. The investment value of the bauxite processing industry is estimated to reach IDR 36.25 trillion in 2027. In addition, this industry will create jobs for 23,200 people. The Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Airlangga Hartanto, estimated that the investment value could increase to US$5.5 billion or around Rp77 trillion. Until the end of 2020, the Galang Batang SEZ was considered the largest investment realization, with a value of around IDR 11 trillion, and succeeded in absorbing a workforce of 3,500 people.\nCurrently, in the Galang Batang SEZ there is one smelter company with an investment value of more than IDR 13 trillion or the equivalent of US$ 910 million. Supported by experts from China, the smelter company has built a steam power plant (PLTU). The company buys bauxite from local areas, such as Bintan, Lingga and Karimun Islands in order to achieve the target of processing one million tons of bauxite into alumina and pursuing alumina exports to Malaysia in mid-2021. Until now, the company continues to increase its aluminum production capacity.\nApart from processing bauxite, the Galang Batang SEZ has the potential to become a textile industrial area. Minister Airlangga said that this was a unique approach in the Galang Batang SEZ. \"\"Men can work in steel factories, while women can work in textile factories,\"\" he said.\"" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 128.2494734, 0.8430947606 ] } },
